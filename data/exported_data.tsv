YVPFP	P47710	Alpha-S1-casein	Homo sapiens	158-162	Anticancer	Inhibits TR7D breast cancer cell proliferation					Identification of a novel opioid peptide (Tyr-Val-Pro-Phe-Pro) derived from human αS1 casein (αS1-casomorphin, and αS1-casomorphin amide)	Kampa, M. et al.	A new casomorphin pentapeptide (αS1-casomorphin) has been isolated from the sequence of human αS1-casein [αS1-casein-(158–162)], with the sequence Tyr-Val-Pro-Phe-Pro. This peptide was found to bind with high affinity to all three subtypes of the κ-opioid receptor (κ1–κ3). When amidated at the C-terminus, αS1-casomorphin amide binds to the Δ- and κ3-opioid sites. Both αS1-casomorphin and its amide inhibit in a dose-dependent and reversible manner the proliferation of T47D human breast cancer cells. This anti-proliferative activity was greater for αS1-casomorphin, which was the most potent opioid in inhibiting T47D cell proliferation. In T47D breast cancer cells, other casomorphins have been found to bind to somatostatin receptors in addition to opioid sites. In contrast, αS1-casomorphin and its amide do not interact with somatostatin receptors in our system.	10.1042/bj3190903

YLGYLE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-111	ACE-inhibitory		85.76				In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

YLGYLE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-111	Increase mucin secretion						Opioid Activities and Structures of α-Casein-Derived Exorphins	Loukas, S. et al.	Exorphins, peptides with opioid activity, have previously been isolated from pepsin hydrolysates of alpha-casein [Zioudrou, C., Streaty, R. A., & Klee, W. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2446-2449]. Analysis of these peptides shows that they correspond to the sequences 90-96, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu, and 90-95, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu, of alpha-casein. These peptides, as well as two of their analogues Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu (91-96) and Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu (91-95), have now been synthesized and characterized. Their opioid activity was examined by three different bioassays: (a) displacement of D-2-alanyl[tyrosyl-3,5-3H]enkephalin-(5-L-methioninamide) and [3H]dihydromorphine from rat brain membranes; (b) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells; (c) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens. The synthetic peptide of sequence 90-96 was the most potent opioid in all three bioassays and its potency was similar to that of the isolated alpha-casein exorphins. The synthetic peptides were totally resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin and homogenates of rat brain membranes, but were partially inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The difference in opioid activity of alpha-casein exorphins may be related to differences in conformational flexibility observed by NMR spectroscopy.	10.1021/bi00288a034
YLGYLE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-111	Increase mucin secretion						Food-Derived Peptides Stimulate Mucin Secretion and Gene Expression in Intestinal Cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k

YFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	159-164	Antioxidant		79.2				Isolation and characterization of free radical scavenging activities peptides derived from casein	Suetsuna, K. et al.	A peptide having the strong free radical scavenging activities was separated from casein protein hydrolysate by chromatographic analyses such as ion-exchange and gel filtration. SP-II fraction obtained by SP-Sephadex C-25 chromatography showed the most potent superoxide anion scavenging activity (SOSA), and it was further separated into a peptide using an octadecylsilano-high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was Tyr-Phe-Tyr-Pro-Glu-Leu (YFYPEL). The concentration of the test compound required to reduce the produced superoxide anion to one-half (IC50) value for SOSA was 79.2 μM using tetrazolium salt 3′-{1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate method. The IC50 value for the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities were 98 and 251 μM, respectively, based on the electron spin resonance method. We characterized SOSA of the C-terminal sequence using EL, PEL, YPEL, and FYPEL. The activities of preferred sequences were EL > YFYPEL > FYPEL > YPEL > PEL, suggesting that the Glu-Leu sequence is important for the activity.	10.1016/s0955-2863(99)00083-2

YFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	159-164	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC5AC expression					Casein hydrolysate and derived peptides stimulate mucin secretion and gene expression in human intestinal cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	The present study was undertaken to explore if a casein hydrolysate and four component peptides with probable ability to interact with opioid receptors can exert a stimulatory effect on mucin production in human intestinal cells (HT29-MTX). αS1-Casein fragments 143–149 (AYFYPEL) and 144–149 (YFYPEL), and the casein hydrolysate, significantly increased expression of MUC5AC, the major secreted mucin gene in this cell line, over 1.7-fold basal level after 4 h of exposure. The determination of mucin-like glycoproteins showed a higher effect on mucin secretion by the casein hydrolysate (210% of controls) than that of AYFYPEL and YFYPEL (around 160%). Therefore, peptides or other components may participate in the activity of the hydrolysate in a synergistic way or through a non-opioid mechanism. In conclusion, a casein hydrolysate and two derived peptides, AYFYPEL and YFYPEL, promote the mucin production and may support the development of functional foods to improve mucus barrier and its protective role in gastrointestinal diseases.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.03.010
YFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	159-164	Opioid						Novel peptides derived from αs1-casein with opioid activity and mucin stimulatory effect on HT29-MTX cells	Fernandez-Tome, S. et al.	The opioid effect of αs1-casein fragments related to 143AYFYPEL149 and 144YFYPEL149, which had previously shown mucin-stimulatory activity in human goblet cells, was investigated. Peptides 144YFYPEL149 and 144YFYPE148 showed opioid agonistic activity in guinea pig ileum, and in mouse vas deferens but to a lower extent. Peptides were partly hydrolysed during the assay and several of the resulting fragments lost the N-terminal Tyr residue. Docking of peptides 144YFYPEL149 (active) and 144YFYP147 (inactive) into the active site of the opioid receptor model showed remarkable differences regarding the flexibility at the third intracellular loop of the receptor and the interaction with Pro at the peptide C-terminus that forced residues Arg148 and Glu166 from the receptor to move towards the interior of the binding pocket. The study on human cells HT29-MTX has shown that 144YFYPEL149 is the minimum fragment able to stimulate MUC5AC expression.	10.1016/j.jff.2016.06.023

RYLGYL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-110	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1
RYLGYL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-110	Opioid						Opioid activities and structures of α-casein-derived exorphins	Loukas, S. et al.	Exorphins, peptides with opioid activity, have previously been isolated from pepsin hydrolysates of alpha-casein [Zioudrou, C., Streaty, R. A., & Klee, W. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2446-2449]. Analysis of these peptides shows that they correspond to the sequences 90-96, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu, and 90-95, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu, of alpha-casein. These peptides, as well as two of their analogues Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu (91-96) and Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu (91-95), have now been synthesized and characterized. Their opioid activity was examined by three different bioassays: (a) displacement of D-2-alanyl[tyrosyl-3,5-3H]enkephalin-(5-L-methioninamide) and [3H]dihydromorphine from rat brain membranes; (b) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells; (c) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens. The synthetic peptide of sequence 90-96 was the most potent opioid in all three bioassays and its potency was similar to that of the isolated alpha-casein exorphins. The synthetic peptides were totally resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin and homogenates of rat brain membranes, but were partially inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The difference in opioid activity of alpha-casein exorphins may be related to differences in conformational flexibility observed by NMR spectroscopy.	10.1021/bi00288a034

RYLGY	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-109	ACE-inhibitory		0.71				Novel casein-derived peptides with antihypertensive activity	Contreras, M. del Mar. et al.	In this study, we report novel casein-derived peptide sequences with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity and antihypertensive activity demonstrated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The peptides were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of total isoelectric casein with pepsin. To identify ACE-inhibitory peptides, the casein hydrolysate was fractionated by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography, and 44 (CN) peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Among the identified peptides, three sequences, that corresponded to αs1-CN f(90–94) (RYLGY), αs1-CN f(143–149) (AYFYPEL), and αS2-CN f(89–95) (YQKFPQY), showed IC50 values as low as 0.71 μm, 6.58 μm, and 20.08 μm, respectively. These three peptides also exerted antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to SHR at a dose of 5 mg kg−1 of body weight. The activity of peptides RYLGY and AYFYPEL in SHR was similar to that found for tripeptide VPP when orally administered at the same dose.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.05.004
RYLGY	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-109	Antihypertensive						Implication of Opioid Receptors in the Antihypertensive Effect of a Bovine Casein Hydrolysate and αs1-Casein Derived Peptides	Sanchez-Rivera, L. et al.	The antihypertensive activity of two αs1-casein-derived peptides and casein hydrolysate containing these sequences was evaluated in the presence of naloxone. The activity was abolished by this opioid antagonist at 2, 4, and 6 h post-administration. Similarly, the antihypertensive effect of the αs1-casein peptides 90RYLGY94 (−23.8 ± 2.5 mmHg) and 143AYFYPEL149 (−21.1 ± 3.2 mmHg) at 5 mg/kg of body weight was antagonized by the co-administration of naloxone. Because peptide 143AYFYPEL149 had recently shown opioid activity, a molecular dynamic simulation of this peptide with human μ-opioid receptor was performed to demonstrate its favorable structure and interaction energy, despite the presence of Ala at the N terminus. Altogether, these results revealed that the in vivo effect on systolic blood pressure of the studied αs1-casein peptides is mediated by interaction with opioid receptors and the antihypertensive activity of casein hydrolysate can be very likely ascribed to them with the possible contribution of other mechanisms.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03872

RYLGY	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-109	Antioxidant						Resistance of casein-derived bioactive peptides to simulated gastrointestinal digestion	Contreras, M. del Mar. et al.	The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008

Similarly, the antihypertensive effect of the αs1-casein peptides 90RYLGY94 (−23.8 ± 2.5 mmHg) and 143AYFYPEL149 (−21.1 ± 3.2 mmHg) at 5 mg/kg of body weight was antagonized by the co-administration of naloxone. Because peptide 143AYFYPEL149 had recently shown opioid activity, a molecular dynamic simulation of this peptide with human μ-opioid receptor was performed to demonstrate its favorable structure and interaction energy, despite the presence of Ala at the N terminus. Altogether, these results revealed that the in vivo effect on systolic blood pressure of the studied αs1-casein peptides is mediated by interaction with opioid receptors and the antihypertensive activity of casein hydrolysate can be very likely ascribed to them with the possible contribution of other mechanisms.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03872
AYFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	158-164	Antioxidant						Resistance of casein-derived bioactive peptides to simulated gastrointestinal digestion	Contreras, M. del Mar. et al.	The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008
AYFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	158-164	Increase mucin secretion						Food-Derived Peptides Stimulate Mucin Secretion and Gene Expression in Intestinal Cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k
AYFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	158-164	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC5AC expression					Casein hydrolysate and derived peptides stimulate mucin secretion and gene expression in human intestinal cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	The present study was undertaken to explore if a casein hydrolysate and four component peptides with probable ability to interact with opioid receptors can exert a stimulatory effect on mucin production in human intestinal cells (HT29-MTX). αS1-Casein fragments 143–149 (AYFYPEL) and 144–149 (YFYPEL), and the casein hydrolysate, significantly increased expression of MUC5AC, the major secreted mucin gene in this cell line, over 1.7-fold basal level after 4 h of exposure. The determination of mucin-like glycoproteins showed a higher effect on mucin secretion by the casein hydrolysate (210% of controls) than that of AYFYPEL and YFYPEL (around 160%). Therefore, peptides or other components may participate in the activity of the hydrolysate in a synergistic way or through a non-opioid mechanism. In conclusion, a casein hydrolysate and two derived peptides, AYFYPEL and YFYPEL, promote the mucin production and may support the development of functional foods to improve mucus barrier and its protective role in gastrointestinal diseases.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.03.010
RFFVAPFPEVFGKEKVNEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	37-55	Osteoanabolic	induce macedocin biosynthesis					Milk Protein Fragments Induce the Biosynthesis of Macedocin, the Lantibiotic Produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198	Georgalaki, M. et al.	The aim of the present work was to study the mode of the induction of the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR). Mass spectrometric (MS) and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of an induction-active fraction showed the presence of several peptides of low molecular mass corresponding to fragments of αS1- and β-casein as well as β-lactoglobulin. The chemically synthesized αS1-casein fragment 37-55 (2,253.65 Da) was proven to be able to induce macedocin biosynthesis. This is the first time that milk protein degradation fragments are reported to exhibit a bacteriocin induction activity.	10.1128/AEM.00151-09
DIPNPI	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	196-201	Bacterial growth promoting	S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus					Isolation and Characterization of Three Novel Peptides from Casein Hydrolysates That Stimulate the Growth of Mixed Cultures ofStreptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspbulgaricus	Zhang, Q. et al.	In this study, sodium caseinate hydrolysates produced by papain with strong growth-stimulating activity for Streptococcus thermophilus (St) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb) were obtained. A series of separation methods including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. Finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, H-2-A, F2-c, and F2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29–35 and 103–108 of bovine αS2-casein and 181–186 of bovine αS1-casein, respectively, were obtained. With supplementation of H-2-A, F2-b, or F2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively. In addition, there were significant (p < 0.05) Increase in viable counts of St and lactic acid production of LAB in the presence of the purified peptides.	10.1021/jf200903u
HPINHR	P18626	Alpha-S1-casein	Capra hircus	19-24	DPP-IV Inhibitory		452.2				Comparison of dipeptidyl peptidase IV-inhibitory activity of peptides from bovine and caprine milk casein by in silico and in vitro analyses	Zhang, Y. et al.	The different potential for release of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-inhibitory peptides from bovine and caprine milk casein was assessed by in silico analysis and in vitro proteolytic assays. The former predicted a weakly higher potency for caprine casein than bovine as a precursor of DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, although with markedly diverse potential for individual caseins. This was verified by protease hydrolysis; trypsin-treated casein hydrolysates (TCAHs) displayed the strongest bioactivity. Fractionation of caprine TCAHs revealed slightly, but significantly, higher inhibitory activity in peptides <5 kDa, and notably greater efficiency in the >5 kDa fraction, than their bovine counterparts. Through in silico trypsin hydrolysis and peptides synthesis, four novel caprine casein-derived DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, including GPFPILV and HPINHR (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 163.7 ± 1.33 and 452.2 ± 7.15 μm, respectively), were found. This study corroborates the weak superiority of caprine casein over bovine in release of DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, and identifies several novel caprine casein-derived DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.10.001
YLGYLEQLLR	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-115	Antianxiety						Bioactive peptides released by in vitro digestion of standard and hydrolyzed infant formulas	Cakir-Kiefer, C. et al.	Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides. Infants fed hydrolyzed infant formulas may be influenced by milk protein-derived bioactive peptides in a manner different from those fed standard formula.	10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.005
YLGYLEQ	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-112	Antianxiety						Transport Across Caco-2 Cell Monolayer and Sensitivity to Hydrolysis of Two Anxiolytic Peptides from αs1-Casein, α-Casozepine, and αs1-Casein-(f91-97): Effect of Bile Salts	Cakir-Kiefer, C. et al.	α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.	10.1021/jf202890e
YLGYLEQ	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-112	Antianxiety						In Vitro Digestibility of r-Casozepine, a Benzodiazepine-like Peptide from Bovine Casein, and Biological Activity of Its Main Proteolytic Fragment	Cakir-Kiefer, C. et al.	α-Casozepine is a peptide, corresponding to the sequence 91−100 of the bovine αs1-casein, displaying anxiolytic activity in the rat. The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.	10.1021/jf104089c
YPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	161-164	Antioxidant						Isolation and characterization of free radical scavenging activities peptides derived from casein	Suetsuna, K. et al.	A peptide having the strong free radical scavenging activities was separated from casein protein hydrolysate by chromatographic analyses such as ion-exchange and gel filtration. SP-II fraction obtained by SP-Sephadex C-25 chromatography showed the most potent superoxide anion scavenging activity (SOSA), and it was further separated into a peptide using an octadecylsilano-high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was Tyr-Phe-Tyr-Pro-Glu-Leu (YFYPEL). The concentration of the test compound required to reduce the produced superoxide anion to one-half (IC50) value for SOSA was 79.2 μM using tetrazolium salt 3′-{1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate method. The IC50 value for the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities were 98 and 251 μM, respectively, based on the electron spin resonance method. We characterized SOSA of the C-terminal sequence using EL, PEL, YPEL, and FYPEL. The activities of preferred sequences were EL > YFYPEL > FYPEL > YPEL > PEL, suggesting that the Glu-Leu sequence is important for the activity.	10.1016/s0955-2863(99)00083-2

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

YLG	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-108	Improves cognition	improves cognitive decline					Orally administered milk derived tripeptide improved cognitive decline in mice fed a high fat diet	Nagai, A. et al.	The functions of the brain, which is thought of as an organ highly independent from the periphery, are often affected by the peripheral environment. Indeed, epidemiologic studies demonstrated that diabetes was a risk factor for dementia. It was also reported that the intake of dairy products, such as milk, reduces the risk of developing dementia. We found that mice on a short-term high-fat diet (HFD) for 1 wk had reduced cognitive function. Thus, using this acute model, we investigated the effects of milk-derived peptide on cognitive decline induced by HFD. Tyr-Leu-Gly (YLG), a tripeptide derived from αS1-casein, a major bovine milk protein, is released by gastrointestinal proteases. We found that orally administered YLG improved cognitive decline induced by 1-wk HFD intake in the object recognition test. YLG also improved cognitive decline in the object location test. Thus, we found that YLG improved cognitive decline induced by HFD. Next, we examined the effects of YLG on the hippocampus, a brain area essential for cognitive function. HFD intake decreased the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells, and this decrease was improved by YLG administration. HFD intake decreased nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, whereas YLG increased NGF and ciliary neurotrophic factor, suggesting that these neurotropic factors play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis after YLG administration. In conclusion, we demonstrated that 1-wk HFD reduced cognitive function. Furthermore, we found that YLG, a milk-derived tripeptide, improved cognitive decline in mice on HFD. The HFD reduced neural stem cell proliferation, and YLG improved this reduction. YLG is the first reported milk peptide to improve cognitive decline induced by HFD intake.-Nagai, A., Mizushige, T., Matsumura, S., Inoue, K., Ohinata, K. Orally administered milk-derived tripeptide improved cognitive decline in mice fed a high-fat diet.	10.1096/fj.201900621R

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991
RYL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-107	Antioxidant						Resistance of casein-derived bioactive peptides to simulated gastrointestinal digestion	Contreras, M. del Mar. et al.	The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008

A peptide having the strong free radical scavenging activities was separated from casein protein hydrolysate by chromatographic analyses such as ion-exchange and gel filtration. SP-II fraction obtained by SP-Sephadex C-25 chromatography showed the most potent superoxide anion scavenging activity (SOSA), and it was further separated into a peptide using an octadecylsilano-high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was Tyr-Phe-Tyr-Pro-Glu-Leu (YFYPEL). The concentration of the test compound required to reduce the produced superoxide anion to one-half (IC50) value for SOSA was 79.2 μM using tetrazolium salt 3′-{1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate method. The IC50 value for the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities were 98 and 251 μM, respectively, based on the electron spin resonance method. We characterized SOSA of the C-terminal sequence using EL, PEL, YPEL, and FYPEL.

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182

Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Significance and impact of the study: This study highlights the potential to exploit Bacillus sp. or the enzymes they produce for the generation of bioactive antimicrobial peptides from bovine casein."	10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03271.x
VLNENLLR	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	30-37	Antimicrobial			MIC	C. sakazakii C. muytjensii		Extensive Manipulation of Caseicins A and B Highlights the Tolerance of These Antimicrobial Peptides to Change	Norberg, S. et al.	Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.	10.1128/AEM.07312-11

Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK.

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X

"Thr-Thr-Met-Pro-Leu-Trp, the C-terminal hexapeptide of αsl-casein, inhibited the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (I50 = 16 μM). Z-Pro-Leu-Trp also inhibited the enzyme (I50 = 18 μM). The Pro- Leu-Trp sequence may be important for the inhibitory activity of this hexapeptide. Z-Pro-Val-Trp, which contains Val in place of Leu, inhibited the enzyme more potently (I50 =2.9 μM).

The antihypertensive activity of this hexapeptide was also investigated. This peptide, when intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 31.8 mg/kg, tended to antagonize the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I."	10.1080/00021369.1987.10868415

This study evaluated four food-derived peptides with known antihypertensive activities for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms, and assessed structure–function relationships using alanine analogues. The peptides (EVSLNSGYY, barley; PGTAVFK, soybean; TTMPLW, α-casein; VHLPP, α-zein) and the six alanine substitution peptides of PGTAVFK were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus and the yeast, Candida albicans. The peptides TTMPLW and PGTAVFK inhibited growth of all four microorganisms tested, with activities of a similar order of magnitude to ampicillin and ethanol controls. EVSLNSGYY inhibited the growth of the bacteria, but VHLPP showed no antimicrobial activity. The alanine analogue, PGAAVFK showed the highest overall antimicrobial activity and PGTAVFA showed no activity; overall, the activities of the analogues were consistent with their structures. Some peptides with antihypertensive activity also show antimicrobial activity, suggesting that food-derived peptides may exert beneficial effects via a number of mechanisms.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.09.094

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains.

"Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum."	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x
RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	16-38	Antimicrobial	In vivo injection Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes Listeria monocytogenes					Antibacterial and immunostimulating casein-derived substances from milk: Casecidin, isracidin peptides	Lahov, E. et al.	Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.	10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6

RPKHPIK	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	16-22	Antimicrobial						Antibacterial Activities of Peptides from the Water-Soluble Extracts of Italian Cheese Varieties	Rizzello, CG. et al.	Water-soluble extracts of 9 Italian cheese varieties that differed mainly for type of cheese milk, starter, technology, and time of ripening were fractionated by reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography, and the antimicrobial activity of each fraction was first assayed toward Lactobacillus sakei A15 by well-diffusion assay. Active fractions were further analyzed by HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry, and peptide sequences were identified by comparison with a proteomic database. Parmigiano Reggiano, Fossa, and Gorgonzola water-soluble extracts did not show antibacterial peptides. Fractions of Pecorino Romano, Canestrato Pugliese, Crescenza, and Caprino del Piemonte contained a mixture of peptides with a high degree of homology. Pasta filata cheeses (Caciocavallo and Mozzarella) also had antibacterial peptides. Peptides showed high levels of homology with N-terminal, C-terminal, or whole fragments of well known antimicrobial or multifunctional peptides reported in the literature: αS1-casokinin (e.g., sheep αS1-casein (CN) f22–30 of Pecorino Romano and cow αS1-CN f24–33 of Canestrato Pugliese); isracidin (e.g., sheep αS1-CN f10–21 of Pecorino Romano); kappacin and casoplatelin (e.g., cow κ-CN f106–115 of Canestrato Pugliese and Crescenza); and β-casomorphin-11 (e.g., goat β-CN f60–68 of Caprino del Piemonte). As shown by the broth microdilution technique, most of the water-soluble fractions had a large spectrum of inhibition (minimal inhibitory concentration of 20 to 200 μg/mL) toward gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, including potentially pathogenic bacteria of clinical interest. Cheeses manufactured from different types of cheese milk (cow, sheep, and goat) have the potential to generate similar peptides with antimicrobial activity.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)72913-1
LRLKKYKVPQL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	114-124	Antimicrobial						An antimicrobial peptide screened from casein hydrolyzate bySaccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity method	Tang, W. et al.	A Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity screening method was developed to separate targeted antimicrobial peptides from the pepsin hydrolyzate of bovine casein. S. cerevisiae cell membranes were first immobilized on the surface of the silica gel to construct an affinity binding medium. A membrane-binding fraction was successfully screened by comparing the RP-HPLC fingerprint chromatograms of the hydrolyzate before and after adsorption with the adsorption medium. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as LRLKKYKVPQL with the use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. The sequence corresponded to amino acid residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein. The results indicated that it is feasible to target screen antimicrobial peptides from protein hydrolyzate using S. cerevisiae cell membranes. The influences of thermal treatment, pH, ions, and enzymes on the activity of the purified peptide were also determined. The activity of the peptide was relatively thermally stable and was pH dependent. It retained more than 90% of its activity in the presence of 15% Na+, K+ and pepsin. Trypsin, proteinase K, divalent cation Mg2+ and Ca2+ reduced the activity to different extents. The peptide also showed antibacterial effectiveness in fresh pear juice. These observations provide further information on the application of protein-derived antimicrobial peptides in food systems.	10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.030

Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.05.005

The primary objective of this study was to improve our understanding of the antimicrobial mechanism of protein-derived peptides and to provide evidence for protein-derived peptides as food bio-preservatives by examining the antimicrobial activities, low cytotoxicity, stabilities, and mechanism of Cp1 (LRLKKYKVPQL). In this study, the protein-derived peptide Cp1 was synthesized from bovine αS1-casein, and its potential use as a food biopreservative was indicated by the higher cell selectivity shown by 11-residue peptide towards bacterial cells than human RBCs. It also showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64–640 μM against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The peptide had low hemolytic activity (23.54%, 512 μM) as well as cytotoxicity. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy experiments indicated that Cp1 exerted its activity by permeabilizing the microbial membrane and destroying cell membrane integrity. We found that Cp1 had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity. The results also revealed that Cp1 could cause cell death by permeabilizing the cell membrane and disrupting membrane integrity. Overall, the findings presented in this study improve our understanding of the antimicrobial potency of Cp1 and provided evidence of the antimicrobial mechanisms of Cp1. The peptide Cp1 could have potential applications as a food biopreservative.	10.3390/molecules23051220

After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182
IKHQGLPQEV	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	21-30	Antimicrobial			MIC	 E. coli B. subtilis		Identification of novel antibacterial peptides isolated from a commercially available casein hydrolysate by autofocusing technique	Elbarbary, H. et al.	Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	10.1002/biof.1023
IKHQGLPQE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	21-29	Antimicrobial			MIC	 C. sakazakii		Production of the antimicrobial peptides Caseicin A and B by Bacillusisolates growing on sodium caseinate	Kent, RM. et al.	"

Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Significance and impact of the study: This study highlights the potential to exploit Bacillus sp. or the enzymes they produce for the generation of bioactive antimicrobial peptides from bovine casein."	10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03271.x
IKHQGLPQE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	21-29	Antimicrobial			MIC	 C. sakazakii C. muytjensii		Extensive Manipulation of Caseins A and B Highlights the Tolerance of These Antimicrobial Peptides to Change	Norberg, S. et al.	Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.	10.1128/AEM.07312-11

FHLGHLK	P09115	Alpha-S1-casein	Oryctolagus cuniculus	19-25	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	B. subtilis		Antibacterial activity of casein-derived peptides isolated from rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) milk	Baranyi, M. et al.	Acid-precipitated rabbit ‘whole casein’ was digested by trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, and clostripain to screen for possible peptides with antibacterial properties. The peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase chromatography. The collected fractions were pooled and their antibacterial properties tested against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus. Three antibacterial peptide fragments derived from tryptic digestion of rabbit casein were isolated and identified. Their sequences were found as follows: HVEQLLR (residues 50–56 of β-casein), ILPFIQSLFPFAER (residues 64–77 of β-casein), and FHLGHLK (residues 19–25 of αs1-casein). The three peptides were synthesized and found to exert antibacterial effect against Gram positive bacteria only. Proteolytic digestion of rabbit casein by chymotrypsin, pepsin and clostripain yielded several peptide fragments with antibacterial activity. Since antibiotic peptides can be released from casein during the digestion of milk proteins, our results suggest a possible antibacterial function of rabbit caseins. It is conceivable that antibacterial peptides can be generated by endopeptidases of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract possibly providing protection for new-born rabbits against aggression of micro-organisms.	10.1017/s0022029903006150

Cytotoxic peptides were isolated from a trypsin digest of bovine αs1-casein by a combination of ion-exchange column chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as an indicator of cytotoxicity toward mouse spleen cells. Amino acids of the isolated peptides were sequenced as arginyl-proly-lysine, leucyl-lysyl-lysine and tyrosyl-lysine, being compatible with sequences 1–3, 101–103 and 104–105 of bovine αs1-casein, respectively. The isolated peptides displayed cytotoxicity toward healthy mouse T and B cells and human leukemic T and B cell lines in a commercially available serum-free medium for lymphocytes, Celgrosser-P, and were named α-casecidins. Similar cytotoxicity was confirmed in chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to sequences 1–3, 101–103 and 100–105 of bovine αs1-casein. The cytotoxicity induced by α-casecidins was concluded to be because of necrosis, and was diminished in the presence of bovine serum albumin.	10.1046/j.1344-3941.2003.00135.x

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1
RYLGYLE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-111	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.	10.1080/1475636031000138723

Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively.

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07

The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2
RPKHPI	P04653	Alpha-S1-casein	Ovis aries	16-21	ACE-inhibitory		40.3				Angiotensin I-Converting-Enzyme-Inhibitory and Antibacterial Peptides from Lactobacillus helveticusPR4 Proteinase-Hydrolyzed Caseins of Milk from Six Species	Minervini, F. et al.	Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003

A total of 75 peptides included in the fraction with molecular mass below 3000 from an 8-month-old Manchego cheese could be identified using HPLC coupled on line to an ion trap mass spectrometer. Some previously described peptides with antihypertensive and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were detected. The formation of five active sequences was followed during cheese ripening in four different batches of Manchego cheese. Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.	10.1016/j.chroma.2004.05.022

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t

Prolyl-rich peptides derived from hydrolysates of bovine caseins have been previously shown to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, suggesting that they may also be able to inhibit the enzymatic activities of prolyl-specific peptidases. This study shows that peptides derived from αS1-casein and β-casein inhibited the enzymatic activities of purified recombinant matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9. The inhibitory efficacy was sequence-dependent. These peptides also selectively inhibited the enzymatic activities of prolyl-amino-peptidases, prolyl-amino-dipeptidases, and prolyl-endopeptidases in extracts of HT-29 and SW480 human colon carcinoma cells, but not in intact cells. They were not cytotoxic or growth inhibitory for these cells. Thus, the prolyl-rich selected peptides were good and selective inhibitors of MMPs and post-proline-cleaving proteases, demonstrating their potential to control inadequate proteolytic activity in the human digestive tract, without inducing cytotoxic effects.	10.1021/jf102803a

"Thr-Thr-Met-Pro-Leu-Trp, the C-terminal hexapeptide of αsl-casein, inhibited the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (I50 = 16 μM). Z-Pro-Leu-Trp also inhibited the enzyme (I50 = 18 μM). The Pro- Leu-Trp sequence may be important for the inhibitory activity of this hexapeptide. Z-Pro-Val-Trp, which contains Val in place of Leu, inhibited the enzyme more potently (I50 =2.9 μM).

The antihypertensive activity of this hexapeptide was also investigated. This peptide, when intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 31.8 mg/kg, tended to antagonize the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I."	10.1080/00021369.1987.10868415

The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.	10.1080/1475636031000138723
LRFF	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	36-39	ACE-inhibitory		116.9				Purification and identification of novel peptides with inhibitory effect against angiotensin I-converting enzyme and optimization of process conditions in milk fermented with the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus	Li, Y. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from milk fermented with the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus Z17 were identified. The optimum process conditions for the production of bioactive peptides were also established. Two novel peptides exhibiting ACE-inhibitory activity were identified from the fermented milk using Sephadex G-15 gel filtration, reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography and MALDI/TOF-TOF MS/MS. The sequences of the two novel peptides were VLSRYP and LRFF with IC50 values of 36.7 and 116.9 µM, respectively. Lineweaver–Burk plots revealed that both peptides behaved as competitive ACE inhibitors. Response surface methodology was used to determine the optimum process conditions for the production of ACE-inhibitory peptides. The results showed that the most significant factors affecting ACE inhibition were fermentation temperature, inoculum level and rotation speed. The maximum ACE-inhibitory activity (81.23%) was observed at temperature 32 °C, initial pH 6.5, inoculum level 6% and rotation speed of 189 rpm. The peptide content and peptidase activity (carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase) had a significant positive effect on ACE inhibition, while endoproteinase activity showed an insignificant effect. The results of this study may contribute to the development of a functional beverage with antihypertensive effects.	10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.043

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007

In this study, we constructed a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory tripeptides from published data (R2 = 0.8437; Q2 = 0.649) and applied the model to screen 27 tripeptides derived from cow milk protein sequences. Potential ACE inhibitory tripeptides were synthesised and evaluated in in vitro/in vivo studies. Results showed that ACE inhibitory activities of tripeptides followed the order (p < 0.05): isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP, commercial) > valine-isoleucine-proline (VIP) > isoleucine-valine-proline (IVP) based on concentrations (7.57–49.72 μm) that decreased 50% of ACE activity. Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) effect of tripeptides in rats (1.5 mg kg−1 body weight dosage) followed the order according to relative lowering SBP rates: IVP (24%) > IPP (17%) > VIP (12%), consistent with results on mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Mg2+ -ATPase gene in rat hearts (p < 0.05). IPP and IVP showed no negative effects on blood glycometabolism.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.10.009

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0

Fresh low-fat milk was fermented with five mixed lactic acid bacteria for up to 30 h at 42 °C. A protease, prozyme 6, was added 5 h after the beginning of fermentation. The whey was separated from the fermented milk and freeze-dried. As the fermentation time extended to 30 h, soluble protein content increased from 30.9 to 195.9 mg g−1, free amino acid content increased from 2.8 to 192.8 mg g−1, peptide content increased from 6.4 to 402.8 mg g−1 and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased from 0 to 80.6 mg 100 g−1, while inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) increased as indicated by a decrease of IC50 from 1.18 to 0.24 mg mL−1, respectively. The amino acid sequences of two ACE inhibitory peptides were Gly–Thr–Trp and Gly–Val–Trp, of which the IC50 values were 464.4 and 240.0 μm, respectively. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were reduced 22 and 21.5 mm Hg, respectively, after 8 weeks of oral administration of diluted whey (peptide concentration 5 mg mL−1) from the 30 h fermentation.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2006.07.004

"The fragment-peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI12, CEI5 and CEIβ7) derived from an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein were synthesized. Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I."	10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase (EC 3.4.15.1) which cleaves dipeptides from the Jree COOH-terminal of peptides. The enzyme hydrolyzes both angiotensin I and bradykinin, generating the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II fiom angiotensin I, and vasoinactive peptides from the vasodilator bradykinin. Inhibitors of ACE were first obtained from the venom of snakes such as Bothrops jararacal ) and Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii) Later, Oshima et a/. found peptide inhibitors of ACE in digests of gelafin with bacterial collagenase) A characteristic of these inhibitors is that they have a Pro-Pro, Ala-Pro or Ala-Hyp sequence at their COOH-terminal. We have observed that a peptide contained in the tryptic hydrolysate of casein inhibits ACE markedly. In this communication, we want to report the purification and determination of the amino acid sequence of an inhibitor in the tryptic hydrolysate of casein.	10.1080/00021369.1982.10865255
FFVAPFPEVFGK	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	38-49	ACE-inhibitory		18.0				Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from tryptic hydrolysate of bovine αS2-casein	Tauzin, J. et al.	Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7
FFVAPFPEVFGK	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	38-49	ACE-inhibitory		52.0				Antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro	Yamada, A. et al.	The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098
FFVAP	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	38-42	ACE-inhibitory		6.0				Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Derived from an Enzymatic Hydrolysate of Casein II Isolation and Bradykinin-potentiating Activity on the Uterus and the Ileum of Rats	Maruyama, S. et al.	Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein. These inhibitors potentiated bradykinin in the contraction of the uterus and the ileum of rats. The ileum was more sensitive to these inhibitors than the uterus. The bradykinin-potentiating activity of these inhibitors on the ileum lasted for more than 90 min even after washing the organ.	10.1080/00021369.1985.10866901
FFVAP	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	38-42	ACE-inhibitory						Characterization of casein-derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X
LAYFYPEL	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	157-164	Immunomodulatory						Enhancement of Antigen-Speciï¬c IFNg Production from CD81 T Cells by a Single Amino Acid-Substituted Peptide Derived from Bovine	Mamoru, T. et al.	Modulation of CD8+T-cell responses specific for an exogenous antigen by epitope variants would be advantageous to develop a novel means of antigen-specific immune regulation. We have analyzed CD8+T-cell responses to single amino acid-substituted variants of a peptide corresponding to residues 142–149 (p142-149; LAYFYPEL) of αs1-casein, a major milk allergen, which is a dominant determinant restricted by H-2Kb. An analog peptide L142I with a substitution of Ile for Leu at the nonanchor N-terminal residue induced more IFN-γ secretion than p142-149 from specific CD8+T cells. Furthermore, L142I could prime CD8+T cells more efficientlyin vivo,and these L142I-primed cells secreted more IFN-γ than p142-149-primed CD8+T cells upon stimulation with p142-149in vitro.These findings are mainly explained by the greater ability of L142I to form stable Kb–peptide complexes. These findings indicate that appropriate analog peptides may be useful as efficient inducers of CD8+T cells which recognize the parent peptide and secrete IFN-γ, a potent inhibitor of Th2-dependent events, including IgE production.	10.1006/clin.1998.4585
QMEAESISSSEEIVPNSVEQK	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	74-94	Immunomodulatory	Stimulated IgG, IgM, IgA production					Identification of a phosphopeptide in bovine α s1-casein digest as a factor influencing proliferation and immunoglobulin production in lymphocyte cultures	Hata, I. et al.	Digestion of bovine αs1-casein with bovine trypsin produced peptide(s) with an inhibitory effect on concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells. One of these peptides was isolated from the αs1-casein digest following ultrafiltration, hydroxyapatite chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, and amino acid composition and sequence analyses showed it to be sequence 59–79 from the phosphoserine-rich region of αs1-casein. The isolated peptide significantly inhibited the concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells, whereas it enhanced the lipopolysaccharide- and phytohaemagglutinin-induced proliferation of both cells. The peptide displayed mitogenic activity in the cell cultures without the commercial mitogen, and significantly enhanced immunoglobulin production. Moreover, residues 1–25 from the phosphoserine-rich region of bovine β-casein had a similar effect on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells stimulated or not stimulated by the commercial mitogen. These results indicate that caseinophosphopeptides may act as a humoral immunostimulator in cell cultures.	10.1017/s0022029998003136
LLQLEAIR	O97943	Alpha-S1-casein	Camelus dromedarius	123-130	DPP-IV Inhibitory		177.8				Identiï¬cation of novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides in camel milk protein hydrolysates	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033
EDVPSER	O62823	Alpha-S1-casein	Bubalus bubalis	99-105	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2
VAPFPE	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	40-45	Cholesterol regulation	Inhibition of cholesterol solubility					Novel milk casein derived peptides decrease cholesterol micellar solubility and cholesterol intestinal absorption in Caco-2 cells	Jiang, X. et al.	This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586
YFYPQL	O62823	Alpha-S1-casein	Bubalus bubalis	159-164	Antioxidant						Antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potential with trans-epithelial transport of a buffalo casein-derived hexapeptide (YFYPQL)	Kandukuri, S. et al.	Inflammation and oxidative stress are two patho-physiological processes that go together. Anti-oxidants can be used as anti-inflammatory mediators to avoid the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. The overlapping antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potentials of a buffalo casein-derived hexapeptide (YFYPQL) were studied with in vitro and ex vivo assays. An in vitro Caco-2 cell model suggested that pre-treatment with the hexapeptide showed protection against H2O2 induced oxidative cell death and inhibited (p ≤ 0.01) ROS generation. Peptide treatment also reduced (p ≤ 0.01) the levels of cellular oxidative products of lipids and proteins (MDA and protein carbonyls) and elevated (p ≤ 0.05) the activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes (CAT, SOD and GPX) by stimulating the nuclear response factor-2 (Nrf-2) stress signalling pathway. Moreover, peptide treatment reduced (p ≤ 0.01) the Nrf-2 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells even in the presence of H2O2. In addition to the antioxidative properties, this peptide also had a role in anti-inflammation with ex vivo conditions by suppressing (p ≤ 0.01) mice splenocytes proliferation and enhancing the phagocytosis of murine peritoneal macrophages. Peptide treatment was also found to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ) and elevated the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in splenocytes culture supernatants. Besides, the hexapeptide showed 0.91 ± 0.04% intact transport across the Caco-2 cell monolayer with an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 4.75 × 10−5 cm min−1 using a transcytosis mediated mechanism. Thus, overlapping antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities as well as transport across the epithelial membrane of the casein hexapeptide was established.	10.1016/j.fbio.2019.02.003

In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production.

PFPEVFGK	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	42-49	ACE-inhibitory		108.0				Short communication: Measuring the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of an 8-amino acid (8mer) fragment of the C12 antihypertensive peptide	Paul, M. et al.	An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.	10.3168/jds.2015-10437
YKVPQLEIVPNSAEER	P02662	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	119-134	Increase calcium uptake					1 phosphorylation	Bioactive Peptides Isolated from Casein Phosphopeptides Enhance Calcium and Magnesium Uptake in Caco-2 Cell Monolayers	Cao, Y. et al.	The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711

Casein-derived antioxidant peptides by using microbial proteases have gained increasing attention. Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.	10.4014/jmb.2104.04013

ILELA	O97943	Alpha-S1-casein	Camelus dromedarius	43-47	DPP-IV Inhibitory		721.1				Identication  of  novel  dipeptidyl  peptidase  IV  (DPP-IV)  inhibitory  peptides  in  camel  milk  protein  hydrolysates.	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033

In this study, casein derived peptides were hydrolyzed with trypsin and then transported across Caco-2 cell monolayers to choose intestinal absorbable antioxidant peptides. E/S ratio at 5.45 %, pH at 7.13 and temperature at 51.99 °C were found to be the optimal conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis of casein by trypsin by Response Surface Method. The fraction below 10 kDa purified by the hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane was applied to Sephadex G-10 gel filtration chromatography, and the obtained components were transported across the Caco-2 cell monolayer. The transported peptides were detected on the basolateral side of the Caco-2 cell monolayer using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. It was found that LHSMK was an unreported pentapeptide. The synthetic peptide LHSMK had free radical scavenging ability, and the antioxidant activity exhibited a dose-dependent increase. Furthermore, LHSMK can also regulate antioxidant enzymes activity in oxidative-damage cells. This study provides a method for the preparation of intestinal absorbable peptides, and provides basic research for the development of functional food market.	10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112194

NPWDQ	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	122-126	Immunomodulatory	Inhibited allergen intestinal permeation					Enzyme-modified cheese exerts inhibitory effects on allergen permeation in rats suffering from indomethacin-induced intestinal inflammation	Isobe, NA. et al.	We have found that an enzyme-modified cheese (EMC) inhibited the permeation of allergens such as ovalbumin (OVA), using Caco-2 cells as an in vitro intestinal epithelial model. In addition, NPWDQ (Asn-Pro-Trp-Asp-Gln, aa 107-111 of αs2-casein) was isolated from EMC and identified as one of the responsible peptides for this inhibitory activity (Tanabe et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., (2007)). In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which NPWDQ inhibited allergen permeation in vitro, and also to evaluate the effects of EMC on allergen permeation in vivo. Intestinal permeability for both fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran and horseradish peroxidase was decreased in Caco-2 cells by the addition of NPWDQ, indicating that NPWDQ might inhibit both paracellular and transcellular transports. Next, intestinal inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injections of indomethacin to rats. When OVA was injected into the jejunal and ileac loops of indomethacin-administered rats with and without NPWDQ, it was found that the addition of NPWDQ effectively diminished OVA permeation from both loops. Although the plasma OVA concentration of indomethacin-administered rats after oral OVA challenge was markedly elevated over that of normal rats, supplemental administration of EMC to the rats effectively suppressed OVA permeation. These results suggest that EMC is useful for the prevention of food allergy by inhibiting allergen permeation probably by enforcing the intestinal barrier.	10.1271/bbb.80042

In this study, sodium caseinate hydrolysates produced by papain with strong growth-stimulating activity for Streptococcus thermophilus (St) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb) were obtained. A series of separation methods including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. Finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, H-2-A, F2-c, and F2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29–35 and 103–108 of bovine αS2-casein and 181–186 of bovine αS1-casein, respectively, were obtained. With supplementation of H-2-A, F2-b, or F2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively.

WIQP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	208-211	ACE-inhibitory		14.2				Peptide identification and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in prolyl endoproteinase digests of bovine αs-casein	Norris, R. et al.	Incubation of sodium caseinate (NaCN) and purified α-casein (αs-CN) with an Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 h resulted in the generation of potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. An ACE IC50 of 21.1 ± 5.1 μg/ml was obtained on incubation of An-PEP with NaCN for 4 h. Fractionation of the NaCN hydrolysates using 3 kDa centrifugal filters resulted in highly active permeate fractions, the most potent being obtained from the 3 h hydrolysate (ACE IC50 = 2.9 ± 0.3 μg/ml). The hydrolytic specificity of An-PEP for purified α-CN was assessed using UPLC ESI MS/MS. The analysis confirmed An-PEP’s cleavage preference for the C-terminal side of Pro and also confirmed that An-PEP has the ability to cleave at the C-terminal of Ala, Leu, Arg and His residues.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.130
WIQP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	208-211	DPP-IV Inhibitory		237.3				Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) by proline containing casein-derived peptides	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Dipeptides with a C terminal Pro inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a key enzyme in incretin hormone processing. It was hypothesised that tri- and tetrapeptides with a proline at the C-terminus may also be DPP-IV inhibitors. Therefore, an in silico hydrolysis approach was used to release short (4 ⩽ amino acids) C terminal Pro peptides from the individual caseins which constitute Pro rich substrates. This was achieved using theoretical digestion of caseins with a prolyl oligopeptidase activity. Fifteen peptides were subsequently selected for in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory analysis. Stability of these peptides to gastrointestinal enzymes was also evaluated in silico and the predicted breakdown peptides were assessed for their DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential. New DPP-IV inhibitors were identified, the most potent being Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (IC50 65.3 ± 3.5 μM). A low in vitro antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging) activity was also associated with the peptides studied. The strategy presented highlights the utility of employing an in silico approach for the prediction of food-derived peptides with a potential role in glycaemic management for subsequent development of functional foods.	10.1016/j.jff.2013.09.012

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group.

The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)–inhibitory and antioxidant activities of peptides in water-soluble extracts, obtained from raw and sterilized ovine and caprine cheeselike systems coagulated with enzymes from the plant Cynara cardunculus, were assessed. Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity.

The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008

Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008
PYVRYL	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	217-222	ACE-inhibitory		2.4				Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Activity of Peptides Derived from Caprine Kefir	Quiros, A. et al.	In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0

The aim of this work was to isolate and identify antibacterial peptides present in a pepsin digest of ovine αs2-casein. A protein digest with antibacterial properties was first separated by ion exchange chromatography. The fractions most active against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were fractionated by semi-preparative RP-HPLC, and the identification of the active peptides was carried out by on-line and off-line RP-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Following this strategy, 10 different peptides were identified, all corresponding to the C-terminal region of the ovine αs2-casein. Four of them were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, ovine αs2-casein f(165–181) exhibited the highest antibacterial potency against all bacteria tested. The antimicrobial activity was compared with that of other previously described peptides like lactoferricin and fragment f(183–207) of bovine αs2-casein.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.10.006

The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences. 	10.1051/lait:2007019

The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated.

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7

WIQPKTKVIPYVRYL	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	208-222	Antimicrobial			MIC	C. sakazakii L. monocytogenes		Structure-activity relationship of synthetic variants of the milk-derived antimicrobial peptide αs2-casein f(183-207)	Alvarez-Ordonez, A. et al.	Template-based studies on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derivatives obtained through manipulation of the amino acid sequence are helpful to identify properties or residues that are important for biological activity. The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.	10.1128/AEM.01394-13

Antimicrobial peptides derived from food proteins constitute a new field in the combined use of antimicrobial agents in food. The best examples of milk-derived peptides are those constituted by bovine lactoferricin [lactoferrin f(17–41)] (LFcin-B) and bovine αs2-casein f(183–207). The aim of this work was to study if the antimicrobial activity of a natural compound employed in food preservation, nisin, could be enhanced by combination with the aforementioned milk-derived peptides. Furthermore, the possibility of a synergistic effect between these peptides and bovine lactoferrin (LF) against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis was also studied. Finally, the most active combinations were assayed against the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella choleraesuis. Results showed a synergistic effect when LFcin-B was combined with bovine LF against E. coli. In the same way, the combination of LFcin-B with bovine LF was synergistic against Staph. epidermidis. Bovine LF and nisin increased their antimicrobial activity when they were assayed together with bovine αs2-casein f(183-207). It is important to note the synergistic effect among LFcin-B and bovine LF, because both compounds might be simultaneously in the suckling gastrointestinal tract and could, therefore, have a protective effect on it. The other synergistic effect high-lighted is that between αs2-casein f(183–207) and nisin against L. monocytogenes because of the ability of L. monocytogenes to develop resistance to nisin.	10.3168/jds.2007-0037

Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.05.005

The aim of this work was to identify the initial binding sites to the bacterial membranes of the antimicrobial peptide αs2-casein f(183–207) and also to acquire further insight into membrane permeabilization of this peptide. Furthermore, cell morphology was studied by transmission electron microscopy. In all the experiments, bovine LFcin was employed as a comparison. Results showed that initial binding sites of αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide were lipoteichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria and lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negative. The peptide was able to permeabilize the outer and inner membranes. Moreover, the αs2-casein peptide f(183–207) generated pores in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. In the Gram-negative bacteria, f(183–207) originated cytoplasm condensation, and in the Gram-positive bacteria the cytoplasmic content leaked into the extracellular medium. Furthermore, the experiments of inner and outer membrane permeabilization performed with LFcin-B showed that this peptide also has the ability to permeabilize both the inner and outer membranes.	10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.06.018

Two distinct domains with antibacterial activity were isolated from a peptic hydrolysate of bovine αs2-casein. The digested αs2-casein was fractionated by cation-exchange chromatography, after which the peptides in the two active fractions obtained were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The major component in each active fraction, f(183–207) and f(164–179), was further purified and the antibacterial activity of these components was tested against several microorganisms. Depending on the target bacterial strain, these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations between 8 and 99 μM. Peptide f(183–207) exhibited a consistently higher antibacterial activity than f(164–179), although both peptides showed a comparable hemolytic effect. A method of in situ enzymatic hydrolysis on a cation-exchange membrane to obtain a fraction enriched in the most active antibacterial domain is presented. The antibacterial and hemolytic activities are discussed in relation to the structure and hydrophobicity of the peptides.	10.1016/s0304-4165(99)00079-3

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

Multifunctional bioactive peptides have a wider role in modulating physiological functions and possess multiple biological activities. Peptides from bovine milk with sequences QKALNEINQF [p10] and TKKTKLTEEEKNRL [p14] from α-S2 casein f (79–88) and α-S2 casein f (148–161) were identified to be having multifunctional biological activities and were synthesized. These synthesized peptides show various biological activities like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, prolyl endopeptidase inhibition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The mode of antimicrobial mechanism was studied and p10 shows depolarization of cell membrane, whereas p14 was found to display DNA-binding activity. Structural studies envisaged backbone flexibility, for differences in their mode of action. Peptide structure function studies were correlated to understand their multifunctional biological activity.	10.1007/s11010-013-1778-4

Two distinct domains with antibacterial activity were isolated from a peptic hydrolysate of bovine αs2-casein. The digested αs2-casein was fractionated by cation-exchange chromatography, after which the peptides in the two active fractions obtained were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The major component in each active fraction, f(183–207) and f(164–179), was further purified and the antibacterial activity of these components was tested against several microorganisms. Depending on the target bacterial strain, these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations between 8 and 99 μM. Peptide f(183–207) exhibited a consistently higher antibacterial activity than f(164–179), although both peptides showed a comparable hemolytic effect. A method of in situ enzymatic hydrolysis on a cation-exchange membrane to obtain a fraction enriched in the most active antibacterial domain is presented.

Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.

The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL.

Template-based studies on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derivatives obtained through manipulation of the amino acid sequence are helpful to identify properties or residues that are important for biological activity. The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007

In this study, we constructed a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory tripeptides from published data (R2 = 0.8437; Q2 = 0.649) and applied the model to screen 27 tripeptides derived from cow milk protein sequences. Potential ACE inhibitory tripeptides were synthesised and evaluated in in vitro/in vivo studies. Results showed that ACE inhibitory activities of tripeptides followed the order (p < 0.05): isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP, commercial) > valine-isoleucine-proline (VIP) > isoleucine-valine-proline (IVP) based on concentrations (7.57–49.72 μm) that decreased 50% of ACE activity. Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) effect of tripeptides in rats (1.5 mg kg−1 body weight dosage) followed the order according to relative lowering SBP rates: IVP (24%) > IPP (17%) > VIP (12%), consistent with results on mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Mg2+ -ATPase gene in rat hearts (p < 0.05). IPP and IVP showed no negative effects on blood glycometabolism.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.10.009

In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003
TKVIP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	213-217	ACE-inhibitory		400.0				Identification of an Antihypertensive Peptide from Casein Hydrolysate Produced by a Proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790	Maeno, M. et al.	Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1
PRKEKLCTTS	P04654	Alpha-S2-casein	Ovis aries	46-55	ACE-inhibitory		142.0				Quantitative structureeactivity relationship based screening of bioactive peptides identified in ripened cheese	Sagardia, I. et al.	The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7

MKP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	205-207	ACE-inhibitory		0.3				Novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide derived from bovine casein	Yamada, A. et al.	Bovine lactic casein was hydrolysed using a combination of three enzymes, namely, subtilisin, bacillolysin, and trypsin, and the resulting preparation was coined CH-3. CH-3 showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity (IC50: 74 μg/mL). A single oral administration of CH-3 led to a transient but significant decrease in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), while daily oral administration of CH-3 for 28 consecutive days led to a lower rate of SBP increase. The CH-3 preparation was then fractionated and the αS2-casein-derived tripeptide Met-Lys-Pro (or MKP) was identified as a novel peptide with strong ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.12 μg/mL, 0.3 μM). The MKP peptide constituted only 0.053% of CH-3 but its activity was accounted for 33% of the total ACE-inhibitory activity of CH-3. In addition, a single oral administration of MKP also led to a transient but significant decrease in the SBP of SHRs.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.06.089
MKP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	205-207	ACE-inhibitory		0.43				Antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro	Yamada, A. et al.	The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098
KFAWPQ	P33049	Alpha-S2-casein	Capra hircus	189-194	ACE-inhibitory		177.1				Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Activity of Peptides Derived from Caprine Kefir	Quiros, A. et al.	In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0
ITP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	134-136	ACE-inhibitory		14.9				Peptide identification and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in prolyl endoproteinase digests of bovine αs-casein	Norris, R. et al.	Incubation of sodium caseinate (NaCN) and purified α-casein (αs-CN) with an Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 h resulted in the generation of potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. An ACE IC50 of 21.1 ± 5.1 μg/ml was obtained on incubation of An-PEP with NaCN for 4 h. Fractionation of the NaCN hydrolysates using 3 kDa centrifugal filters resulted in highly active permeate fractions, the most potent being obtained from the 3 h hydrolysate (ACE IC50 = 2.9 ± 0.3 μg/ml). The hydrolytic specificity of An-PEP for purified α-CN was assessed using UPLC ESI MS/MS. The analysis confirmed An-PEP’s cleavage preference for the C-terminal side of Pro and also confirmed that An-PEP has the ability to cleave at the C-terminal of Ala, Leu, Arg and His residues.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.130
IQP	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	209-211	ACE-inhibitory		106.7				Screening milk-derived antihypertensive peptides using quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modelling and in vitro/in vivo studies on their bioactivity	Jing, P. et al.	In this study, we constructed a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory tripeptides from published data (R2 = 0.8437; Q2 = 0.649) and applied the model to screen 27 tripeptides derived from cow milk protein sequences. Potential ACE inhibitory tripeptides were synthesised and evaluated in in vitro/in vivo studies. Results showed that ACE inhibitory activities of tripeptides followed the order (p < 0.05): isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP, commercial) > valine-isoleucine-proline (VIP) > isoleucine-valine-proline (IVP) based on concentrations (7.57–49.72 μm) that decreased 50% of ACE activity. Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) effect of tripeptides in rats (1.5 mg kg−1 body weight dosage) followed the order according to relative lowering SBP rates: IVP (24%) > IPP (17%) > VIP (12%), consistent with results on mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Mg2+ -ATPase gene in rat hearts (p < 0.05). IPP and IVP showed no negative effects on blood glycometabolism.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.10.009
IPY	P04654	Alpha-S2-casein	Ovis aries	217-219	ACE-inhibitory		206.0				Angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory activity of peptides isolated from Manchego cheese Stability under simulated gastrointestinal digestion	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007

NMAINPSKENLCSTFCK	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	40-56	ACE-inhibitory		129.07				Identiï¬cation of a novel ACE-inhibitory peptide from casein and evaluationof the inhibitory mechanisms	Maolin, T. et al.	Various bioactive peptides are continuously being identified from casein hydrolysates. In this work, a novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACEI) peptide, NMAINPSKENLCSTFCK, derived from the αs2-casein fragment residues 25–41, was screened and identified by UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS from tryptic casein hydrolysate. The IC50 value of the peptide, determined by an HPLC method, was 129.07 μM. The Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that this peptide acted as a mixed-type inhibitor against ACE, which might be attributed to the peptide being susceptible to degradation by ACE, indicating that the mixed-type inhibition could partly be a result of newly generated peptide fragments. The physicochemical characteristics and the secondary structure were evaluated by circular dichroism analysis and online prediction software (Expasy, PepDraw, and ProtParam) to identify the basic characteristics of this peptide. Moreover, molecular docking was simulated by Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software to provide the potential mechanisms underlying the ACEI activity of the peptides.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.02.107
SSSEESII	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	23-30	Antimicrobial						Antibacterial activity of new peptide from bovine casein hydrolyzed by a serine metalloprotease of Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis BR16	Bougherra, F. et al.	An extracellular serine metalloprotease produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis BR16 isolated from Algerian traditional fermented food was used for hydrolyzing bovine casein in order to identify antibacterial peptide. Antibacterial peptide was separated from peptic hydrolysates by adsorption/desorption then analyzed using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and active fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A new antibacterial peptide was identified as SSSEESII from the subunit αs2 of casein corresponding of the fragment (24–31). This peptide demonstrated antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria: Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, and two Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076. Prediction of peptide secondary structure indicated that this peptide is anionic and must have random coil structure with a small region of hydrophobicity, which confers to the peptide unusual behavior compared to conventional antimicrobial peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.02.026
KTVDMESTEVFTKKTKLTEEEKNRLNFLKK	P02663	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	152-181	Antimicrobial						Inhibitory effect of milk-derived peptide αS2-casein151-181 against spore-forming bacteria	Liu, Y. et al.	In this study, the antimicrobial activity of milk-derived peptide αS2-casein151-181 against Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration of αS2-casein151-181 against B. subtilis was between 3.10 and 6.67 μm and the minimum bactericidal concentration was below 16.00 μm. Peptide αS2-casein151-181 generated pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of B. subtilis and resulted in PI uptake and leakage of cell constituents. Treatment with αS2-casein151-181 also caused a loss of membrane potential as measured by DiOC2 fluorescence. These data suggest that αS2-casein151-181 kills B. subtilis through the disruption of cell membrane, allowing cell constituents to leak out of the cell, which is followed by a loss of membrane potential and cell death. Furthermore, αS2-casein151-181 also acted against B. subtilis spores (1 × 106 spores mL−1) with an IC50 and an IC90 of 8.07 μm and 16.22 μm, respectively.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2020.104651

In this study, we identified a novel angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide, YQKFPQYLQY (YQK), derived from bovine casein. Casein was hydrolyzed using pepsin and trypsin. The target peptide, YQK, was separated from the hydrolysate by ultrafiltration and Sephadex G-15chromatography. The IC50 value of YQK was 11.1 μM. YQK retained its ACE inhibitory activity under various temperature and pH conditions. It was also stable against the digestive enzymes pepsin and trypsin. The Lineweaver–Burk plot suggested that the inhibitory mode of YQK was competitive. Furthermore, its antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) also revealed that oral administration of YQK can significantly decrease systolic blood pressure. These results suggested that YQK may have potential applications in functional foods or pharmaceuticals as an antihypertensive agent.	10.1016/j.peptides.2017.09.021
NAVPITPTL	A0A1L6KYI1	Alpha-S2-casein	Bubalus bubalis	130-138	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation.	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2

Hypertension is a major risk factor leading to cardiovascular disease, and is frequently treated with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. The objective of this study was to separate and identify an ACE-inhibitory peptide from goat milk casein hydrolysates, and to evaluate its potential for improving angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated adverse effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). A novel ACE-inhibitory peptide with the highest activity from the goat milk casein hydrolysates as determined by four steps of RP-HPLC was purified and identified as Phe-Pro-Gln-Tyr-Leu-Gln-Tyr-Pro-Tyr (FPQYLQYPY). The results of inhibitory kinetics studies indicated that the peptide was a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE. Gastrointestinal digest in vitro analysis showed that the hydrolysate of FPQYLQYPY was still active after digestion with gastrointestinal proteases. Moreover, we found that the peptide could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of Ang II-stimulated VSMCs. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in the cardiovascular disease-related pathways, and that the peptide may have the ability to regulate vascular remodeling. Our findings indicate the potential anti-hypertensive effects of FPQYLQYPY, as well-implicate its role in regulating vascular dysfunction.	10.3389/fnut.2022.878768
KALNEINQF	E9NZN2	Alpha-S2-casein	Bubalus bubalis	95-103	Antioxidant						Peptides  Isolated  from  Yak  Milk  Residue  Exert  Antioxidant  Effects  through  Nrf2  Signal  Pathway	Yang, F.  et al.	Food-derived bioactive peptides are considered as the important sources of natural bioactive ingredients. Approximately 3094 peptides were identified by nESI-LC–MS/MS in the hydrolyzed yak milk residue. Peptide KALNEINQF (T10) is the strongest antioxidant peptide. The damage model of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used to evaluate the antioxidant effect. After treatment with 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL T10 peptide, T10 obviously decreased H2O2-induced damage and increased the cell survival. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly increased 1.03, 1.1, and 1.33 times, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly increased 1.11, 1.30, and 1.43 times, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) also reduced 1.41, 1.54, and 1.72 times, respectively. T10 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, and protein expressions of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax were increased and decreased by 1.95 and 1.44 times, respectively, suggesting T10 decreases apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, the RNA expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.00, 2.11, and 1.94 times; the protein expressions of p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.67, 1.73, and 1.04 times; and Keap1 was downregulated by 3.9 and 1.32 times, respectively. T10 also regulated the Nrf2 pathway and expressions of related genes (Keap1, HO-1, and NQO1), and blocking the Nrf2 pathway in the model decreased the protective effect of T10. Taken together, T10 peptide isolated from yak milk residue has a protective effect against H2O2-induced damage in HUVECs and the molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and cell apoptosis.	10.1155/2021/9426314
WV	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	45-46	DPP-IV Inhibitory		65.69				Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory and antioxidative properties of milk protein-derived dipeptides and hydrolysates	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Selected synthetic dipeptides and milk protein hydrolysates were evaluated for their dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory properties, and their superoxide (SO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities. DPP-IV inhibition was seen with eight out of the twelve dipeptides and 5 of the twelve hydrolysates studied. Trp-Val inhibited DPP-IV, however, inhibition was not observed with the reverse peptide Val-Trp. The most potent hydrolysate inhibitors were generated from casein (CasH2) and lactoferrin (LFH1). Two Trp containing dipeptides, Trp-Val and Val-Trp, and three lactoferrin hydrolysates scavenged DPPH. The dipeptides had higher SO EC(50) values compared to the milk protein hydrolysates (arising from three lactoferrin and one whey protein hydrolysates). Higher molecular mass fractions of the milk protein hydrolysates were associated with the SO scavenging activity. Trp-Val and one lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH1) were multifunctional displaying both DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant (SO and DPPH scavenging) activities. These compounds may have potential as dietary ingredients in the management of type 2 diabetes by virtue of their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and to extend the half-life of incretin molecules.	10.1016/j.peptides.2012.11.016
RELKDLK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	29-35	Increase cellular growth	mice splenocyte					Proliferative effects of synthetic peptides from β-lactoglobulin and α-Lactalbumin on murine splenocytes	Jacquot, A. et al.	Eleven peptides, selected on the basis of physicochemical characteristics and their theoretical release from β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-La) by trypsin or chymotrypsin, were chemically synthesised to evaluate their immunomodulating properties. Murine splenocyte proliferation in the absence and presence of mitogen and different peptide concentrations were measured after 72–96 h incubations. β-Lg f78–83 had no effect on proliferation; β-Lg f15–20, f55–60, f84–91, f92–105, f139–148, f142–148 and α-La f10–16 stimulated proliferation to different extents; β-Lg f1–8, f102–105 and α-La f104–108 showed a cytotoxic effect. Regression analysis revealed the relationship of positive charge, hydrophobicity and length to the stimulatory proliferative effect. β-Lg f15–20, f55–60 and f139–148 also induced various inhibiting and/or stimulating effects on cytokine secretion. The results confirm that peptides releasable by digestive enzymes from α-La and β-Lg have the potential to influence the specific immune response through the modulation of splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.02.013
YGLF	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	69-72	ACE-inhibitory						α-Lactorphin lowers blood pressure measured by radiotelemetry in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats	Nurminen, M-L. et al.	Cardiovascular effects of subcutaneous administration of synthetic α-lactorphin, a tetrapeptide (Tyr-Gly-Leu-Phe) originally derived from milk α-lactalbumin, were studied in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) with continuous radiotelemetric monitoring. α-Lactorphin dose-dependently lowered blood pressure (BP) without affecting heart rate in SHR and WKY. The lowest dose which reduced BP was 10 μg/kg, and the maximal reductions in systolic and diastolic BP (by 23 ± 4 and 17 ± 4 mm Hg, respectively) were observed at 100 μg/kg dose in SHR. No further reductions were obtained at a higher dose of 1 mg/kg. There were no significant differences in the BP responses to α-lactorphin between SHR and WKY. Naloxone (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.), a specific opioid receptor antagonist, abolished the α-lactorphin-induced reduction in BP and reversed it into a pressor response, which provides evidence for an involvement of opioid receptors in the depressor action of the tetrapeptide.	10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00471-9

Related dipeptidesalso  inhibited ACE, with  Tyr-Leu  being  the  most  po-tent, having an IC50 value  of 122.1  	10.1515/bchm3.1996.377.4.259
YGLF	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	69-72	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991
YGLF	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	69-72	DPP-IV Inhibitory						Bioactive peptides derived from bovine whey proteins: opioid and ace-inhibitory peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	Regulatory peptides can be released by enzymatic proteolysis of food proteins and may act as potential physiological modulators of metabolism during the intestinal digestion of the diet. The possible regulatory effects of peptides relate to nutrient uptake, immune defence, opioid and antihypertensive activities. Milk proteins, especially caseins, are an important source of these bioactive peptides. During recent years, major whey protein components, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin, were also shown to contain bioactive sequences. Peptides showing opioid and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity were found in α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. Opioid peptides, α-lactorphin and β-lactorphin, were liberated during in vitro proteolysis of bovine whey proteins, and pharmacological activity was observed at micromolar concentrations. Whey hydrolysates showed ACE-inhibitory activity after proteolysis with different digestive enzymes, and several active peptides were identified. The results demonstrated the existence of several biologically active whey-derived peptides and hydrolysates. The findings of the study can be exploited in the development of foods with special health claims (e.g. treatment of hypertension) as well as in identifying new applications in food.	10.1016/S0924-2244(01)00003-6
YGLF	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	69-72	Increase mucin secretion						Food-Derived Peptides Stimulate Mucin Secretion and Gene Expression in Intestinal Cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k

WLAHKALCSEKLDQ	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	123-136	DPP-IV Inhibitory		141.0				Isolation and characterization of peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory activity from pepsin-treated bovine whey proteins	Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV is one of the strategies used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, pepsin-treated whey protein isolate (WPI) and α-lactalbumin displaying DPP-IV inhibitory activity were fractionated by successive chromatographic steps and the resulting active fractions analyzed for their constituent peptides by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 24 peptides derived from α-lactalbumin and 11 from β-lactoglobulin were synthesized and their effects on DPP-IV activity assessed. The most potent fragments, LKPTPEGDL and LKPTPEGDLEIL (IC50 = 45 and 57 μM, respectively), were found to inhibit DPP-IV in an un-competitive manner. Although several of the peptides tested showed some inhibitory activity, only two were as effective as the un-fractionated WPI hydrolysate and none were as potent as the un-fractionated α-lactalbumin hydrolysate. The peptides’ structural features, including length and amino acid composition, were found to impact their inhibitory activity. This study provides new insights on the active components responsible for the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of pepsin-treated whey proteins.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.01.002

Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are useful strategies for managing, respectively, diabetes and hypertension, two conditions often occurring together. In this study, debittered and non-debittered whey protein hydrolysates (WPHs) were assessed for their in vitro inhibitory activity against ACE and DPP-IV and characterized for their constituent peptides. All WPHs and several fractions obtained from them had ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities, with ACE being generally more strongly inhibited than DPP-IV. Among the identified peptides tested, GYGGVSLPEW derived from α-lactalbumin and LKPTPEGDLE from β-lactoglobulin were, respectively, the most effective at inhibiting ACE (IC50 = 2 µM) and DPP-IV (IC50 = 42 µM). Although some identified peptides were able to inhibit both enzymes, the majority did not show a dual inhibitory effect. This research provides new insight on the active peptides responsible for the ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities of whey protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.jff.2015.11.038

Ile–Trp (IW) and Trp–Leu (WL) are present in enzymatic hydrolysates of whey proteins and act as efficient inhibitors for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro. Baseline plasma concentrations of IW and WL were analysed to 0.9 ± 0.3 nm for IW and 8.3 ± 1.3 nm for WL. Following administration of 50 mg IW or 100 mg WL to human volunteers (n = 3 for IW and n = 2 for WL, respectively), a significant increase in plasma concentrations to a maximum of 2.4 ± 0.5 nm for IW and 29–36 nm for WL after 0.5 h was observed, followed by rapid elimination. ACE activity in plasma decreased by 32% ± 8% following 50 mg IW administration. Administration of the corresponding amino acids had no effect on ACE activity. Thus, these tryptophan-containing dipeptides may serve as bioactive food additives with beneficial effects for the cardiovascular system.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.09.004

Short peptides in food protein hydrolysates are of significant interest as they may be highly bioactive whilst also being bioavailable. A dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) was fractionated using nanofiltration (NF) with a 200 Da MWCO membrane. The DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration of the NF permeate (IC50 = 0.66 ± 0.08 mg protein equivalent mL− 1) was significantly more potent (P > 0.05) than that of the starting WPH (IC50 = 0.94 ± 0.24 mg protein equivalent mL− 1) and associated retentate (IC50 = 0.82 ± 0.13 mg protein equivalent mL− 1). This confirmed the contribution of short peptides within the NF permeate to the overall DPP-IV inhibitory activity. An hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC-) and reverse-phase (RP-) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) strategy, based on two retention time models, allowed detection of eight free amino acids and eight di- to tetrapeptides in the NF permeate. The potential sequences of the peptides within the NF permeate were then ranked on the basis of their highest probability of occurrence. A confirmatory study with synthetic peptides showed that valine–alanine (VA), valine–leucine (VL), tryptophan–leucine (WL) and tryptophan–isoleucine (WI) displayed DPP-IV IC50 values < 170 μM. The NF and LC–MS strategies employed herein represent a new approach for the targeted identification of short peptides within bioactive food protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.foodres.2015.09.012

ILDKVGINY	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	114-122	DPP-IV Inhibitory		263.0				Isolation and characterization of peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory activity from pepsin-treated bovine whey proteins	Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV is one of the strategies used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, pepsin-treated whey protein isolate (WPI) and α-lactalbumin displaying DPP-IV inhibitory activity were fractionated by successive chromatographic steps and the resulting active fractions analyzed for their constituent peptides by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 24 peptides derived from α-lactalbumin and 11 from β-lactoglobulin were synthesized and their effects on DPP-IV activity assessed. The most potent fragments, LKPTPEGDL and LKPTPEGDLEIL (IC50 = 45 and 57 μM, respectively), were found to inhibit DPP-IV in an un-competitive manner. Although several of the peptides tested showed some inhibitory activity, only two were as effective as the un-fractionated WPI hydrolysate and none were as potent as the un-fractionated α-lactalbumin hydrolysate. The peptides’ structural features, including length and amino acid composition, were found to impact their inhibitory activity. This study provides new insights on the active components responsible for the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of pepsin-treated whey proteins.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.01.002
ILDKVGINY	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	114-122	DPP-IV Inhibitory						Identification of novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides in camel milk protein hydrolysates	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033
WLAHK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	123-127	ACE-inhibitory		77.0				Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of whey protein digests: concentration and characterization of active peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	The aim of this study was to identify whey-derived peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The bovine whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination. The total hydrolysates were fractionated in a two step ultrafiltration process, first with a 30 kDa membrane and then with a 1 kDa membrane. Inhibition of ACE was analysed spectrophotometrically. The peptides were isolated by chromatography and identified by mass and sequencing analysis. The most potent inhibitory peptides were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50 % inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345–1733 μg/ml. The IC50 values for the 1–30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 μg/ml and for the <1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77–1062 μM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were α-lactalbumin fractions (50–52), (99–108) and (104–108) and β-lactoglobulin fractions (22–25), (32–40), (81–83), (94–100), (106–111) and (142–146).	10.1017/s0022029999003982
WLAHK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	123-127	ACE-inhibitory		0.6				Preparation of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory hydrolysates from unsupplemented caprine whey fermentation by various cheese microflora	Didelot, S. et al.	Unsupplemented caprine whey was fermented by 25 cheese microflora in order to produce peptides from α-lactalbumin (α-la) and/or β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) hydrolysis. Fourteen hydrolysates enriched in peptides mainly released from α-la were obtained. Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of each hydrolysate was investigated. Six of them had high ACE inhibitory activities ranging from 31% to 56%. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was obtained after whey fermentation by the microflora from 18 months ripened Comté cheese. The microflora was identified as a co-culture of Candida parapsilosis and Lactobacillus paracasei. Hydrolysate activity remained stable after pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin treatments simulating an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. This hydrolysate was further fractionated by RP-HPLC. The peptide exhibiting the highest ACE inhibitory activity was characterised as WLAHK (α-la f(104–108): Trp–Leu–Ala–His–Lys). WLAHK was resistant toward pepsin and trypsin treatments but was digested by chymotrypsin.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.09.009
WLAHK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	123-127	Cytotoxic	mice splenocyte					Proliferative effects of synthetic peptides from β-lactoglobulin and α-Lactalbumin on murine splenocytes	Jacquot, A. et al.	Eleven peptides, selected on the basis of physicochemical characteristics and their theoretical release from β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-La) by trypsin or chymotrypsin, were chemically synthesised to evaluate their immunomodulating properties. Murine splenocyte proliferation in the absence and presence of mitogen and different peptide concentrations were measured after 72–96 h incubations. β-Lg f78–83 had no effect on proliferation; β-Lg f15–20, f55–60, f84–91, f92–105, f139–148, f142–148 and α-La f10–16 stimulated proliferation to different extents; β-Lg f1–8, f102–105 and α-La f104–108 showed a cytotoxic effect. Regression analysis revealed the relationship of positive charge, hydrophobicity and length to the stimulatory proliferative effect. β-Lg f15–20, f55–60 and f139–148 also induced various inhibiting and/or stimulating effects on cytokine secretion. The results confirm that peptides releasable by digestive enzymes from α-La and β-Lg have the potential to influence the specific immune response through the modulation of splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.02.013
WLAHK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	123-127	Osteoanabolic						Osteoanabolic activity of whey-derived anti-oxidative (MHIRL and YVEEL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (YLLF, ALPMHIR, IPA and WLAHK) bioactive peptides	Pandey, M. et al.	Exploring bone rebuilding anabolic agents has been gaining much attention due to their potential therapeutic effects in treating several bone disorders including osteoporosis. Whey protein has been reported to affect bone health osteoanabolically, in terms of proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells. This study investigates whether whey derived anti-oxidative (AO) (P1- MHIRL, P2- YVEEL) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) (P3- YLLF, P4-ALPMHIR, P5-IPA, P6- WLAHK) bioactive peptides affect the proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells isolated from rat calvaria. The proliferation and osteogenic activity of osteoblast cells in presence of these peptides were determined by MTT assay, DNA quantification study, Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and ALP staining, Alizarin red activity and staining, and secretory osteocalcin measurement. The expression of osteogenesis-related genes (COLI-α, ALP, OCN and RUNX2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis over a period of 21 days. The peptide treated osteoblasts showed a significant increase in viable cell density and proliferation in the order of P2 > P6 > P3 at optimised concentration. Furthermore, the osteoblastic differentiation markers in response to these peptides were found to be significantly up regulated in the order of P2 > P6 > P3 when compared to the controls. These results demonstrated that bioactive whey-derived AO and ACE inhibitory peptides can play a potential therapeutic role in osteoporosis by activating osteoblasts anabolically.	10.1016/j.peptides.2017.11.004
EQLTK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	20-24	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	B. subtilis S. lentus		Isolation and identification of three bactericidal domains in the bovine α-Lactalbumin molecule	Pellegrini, A. et al.	Proteolytic digestion of alpha-lactalbumin by pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin yielded three polypeptide fragments with bactericidal properties. Two fragments were obtained from the tryptic digestion. One was a pentapeptide with the sequence EQLTK (residues 1-5) and the other, GYGGVSLPEWVCTTF ALCSEK (residues (17-31)S-S(109-114)), was composed of two polypeptide chains held together by a disulfide bridge. Fragmentation of alpha-lactalbumin by chymotrypsin yielded CKDDQNPH ISCDKF (residues (61-68)S-S(75-80)), also a polypeptide composed of two polypeptide chains held together by a disulfide bridge. The three polypeptides were synthesized and found to exert antimicrobial activities. The polypeptides were mostly active against Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria were only poorly susceptible to the bactericidal action of the polypeptides. GYGGVSLPEWVCTTF ALCSEK was most, EQLTK least bactericidal. Replacement of leucine (23) with isoleucine, having a similar chemical structure but higher hydrophobicity, in the sequence GYGGVSLPEWVCTTF ALCSEK significantly reduced the bactericidal capacity of the polypeptide. Digestion of alpha-lactalbumin by pepsin yielded several polypeptide fragments without antibacterial activity. alpha-Lactalbumin in contrast to its polypeptide fragments was not bactericidal against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of alpha-lactalbumin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases.	10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00165-2
WLA	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	123-125	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Isolation and characterization of anti-inflammatory peptides derived from whey protein	Ma, Y. et al.	The present study was conducted to isolate and characterize anti-inflammatory peptides from whey protein hydrolysates using alcalase. Nine subfractions were obtained after sequential purification by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25 gel (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) filtration chromatography, and preparative HPLC. Among them, subfraction F4e showed the strongest inhibitory activity on interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Eight peptides, including 2 new peptides—Asp-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Tyr (DYKKY) and Asp-Gln-Trp-Leu (DQWL)—were identified from subfractions F4c and F4e, respectively, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide DQWL showed the strongest inhibitory ability on IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and TNF-α mRNA expression and production of IL-1β and TNF-α proteins at concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, DQWL treatment significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation by suppressing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 and blocking inhibitor κB kinase phosphorylation and inhibitor κB degradation together with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our study suggests that peptide DQWL has anti-inflammatory potential; further confirmation using an in vivo model is needed.	10.3168/jds.2016-11186

YGGVSLPEW	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	37-45	ACE-inhibitory		16.0				Fractionation and identification of ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-Lactalbumin and β-casein produced by thermolysin-catalysed hydrolysis	Otte, J. et al.	The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X

Tavares, TG. et al.	The remarkable longevity of people in specific regions of Portugal, whose diets are based on whey cheese, has puzzled researchers for quite some time. Our data indicate that several oligopeptides are released from glycomacropeptide (originated in κ-casein) and α-lactalbumin – and one surprisingly from β-lactoglobulin, by plant proteases previously used in cheesemaking. A few of such peptides (e.g. DKVGINYW, KGYGGVSLPEW and DAQSAPLRVY) exhibit unusually strong antihypertensive roles in vitro, following generation in situ or synthesis de novo. The activities of the latter two are not significantly affected by simulated gastrointestinal digestion, despite undergoing partial hydrolysis. This piece of information is rather promising toward more comprehensive attempts to scientifically rationalise this Portuguese Paradox.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.09.052

Whey protein concentrate (WPC) was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by proteases from the flowers of Cynara cardunculus, and the resulting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect was monitored. The whole WPC hydrolysate exhibited an IC50 value of 52.9 ± 2.9 μg/mL, whereas the associated peptide fraction with molecular weight below 3 kDa scored 23.6 ± 1.1 μg/mL. The latter fraction was submitted to RP-HPLC, and 6 fractions were resolved that exhibited ACE-inhibitory effects. Among the various peptides found, a total of 14 were identified via sequencing with an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Eleven of these peptides were synthesized de novo – to validate their ACE-inhibitory effect, and also to ascertain their stability when exposed to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Among them, three novel, highly potent peptides were found, corresponding to α-lactalbumin f(16–26) – with the sequence KGYGGVSLPEW, α-lactalbumin f(97–104) with DKVGINYW, and β-lactoglobulin f(33–42) with DAQSAPLRVY; their IC50 values were as low as 0.80 ± 0.1, 25.2 ± 1.0 and 13.0 ± 1.0 μg/mL, respectively. None of them remained stable in the presence of gastrointestinal enzymes: they were partially, or even totally hydrolyzed to smaller peptides – yet the observed ACE-inhibitory effects were not severely affected for two of those peptides.	10.1016/j.peptides.2011.02.005

IW	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	78-79	ACE-inhibitory		0.7				Tryptophan-containing dipeptides are bioavailable and inhibit plasma human angiotensin-converting enzyme in vivo	Kaiser, SA. et al.	Ile–Trp (IW) and Trp–Leu (WL) are present in enzymatic hydrolysates of whey proteins and act as efficient inhibitors for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro. Baseline plasma concentrations of IW and WL were analysed to 0.9 ± 0.3 nm for IW and 8.3 ± 1.3 nm for WL. Following administration of 50 mg IW or 100 mg WL to human volunteers (n = 3 for IW and n = 2 for WL, respectively), a significant increase in plasma concentrations to a maximum of 2.4 ± 0.5 nm for IW and 29–36 nm for WL after 0.5 h was observed, followed by rapid elimination. ACE activity in plasma decreased by 32% ± 8% following 50 mg IW administration. Administration of the corresponding amino acids had no effect on ACE activity. Thus, these tryptophan-containing dipeptides may serve as bioactive food additives with beneficial effects for the cardiovascular system.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.09.004
GYGGVSLPEW	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	36-45	ACE-inhibitory		2.0				Do whey protein-derived peptides have dual dipeptidyl-peptidase IV and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activities?	Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are useful strategies for managing, respectively, diabetes and hypertension, two conditions often occurring together. In this study, debittered and non-debittered whey protein hydrolysates (WPHs) were assessed for their in vitro inhibitory activity against ACE and DPP-IV and characterized for their constituent peptides. All WPHs and several fractions obtained from them had ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities, with ACE being generally more strongly inhibited than DPP-IV. Among the identified peptides tested, GYGGVSLPEW derived from α-lactalbumin and LKPTPEGDLE from β-lactoglobulin were, respectively, the most effective at inhibiting ACE (IC50 = 2 µM) and DPP-IV (IC50 = 42 µM). Although some identified peptides were able to inhibit both enzymes, the majority did not show a dual inhibitory effect. This research provides new insight on the active peptides responsible for the ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities of whey protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.jff.2015.11.038
GVSLPEW	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	39-45	ACE-inhibitory		30.0				Fractionation and identification of ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-Lactalbumin and β-casein produced by thermolysin-catalysed hydrolysis	Otte, J. et al.	The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008
DKVGINYW	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	116-123	ACE-inhibitory						Acute effect of whey peptides upon blood pressure of hypertensive rats, and relationship with their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity	Tavares, TG. et al.	"
Scope: The aim of this study was to investigate the antihypertensive effect of a peptide fraction (PepC) obtained from a whey protein concentrate following hydrolysis by Cynara cardunculus, as well as of its fraction with MW below 3 kDa (PepCF). Both these concentrates encompassed peptides that exhibited potent in vitro inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE): two were released from α-lactalbumin – KGYGGVSLPEW and DKVGINYW, and one from β-lactoglobulin – DAQSAPLRVY.

Methods and results: Upon oral administration, by gastric intubation, of 400 mg/kg body weight (bw) of those peptide concentrates, or 5 mg/kg bw of the corresponding synthetic peptides, to 12 wk-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were monitored by the tail-cuff method – before, and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h afterwards. Water and zofenopril (5 mg/kg bw) – a known ACE-inhibitor, were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Acute administration of PepC, PepCF, KGYGGVSLPEW, DKVGINYW and DAQSAPLRVY caused antihypertensive effects in SHR; the maximum effect occurred by 4 h and 6 h after administration of the peptide concentrates and the synthetic peptides, respectively. PepC and KGYGGVSLPEW also showed ACE-inhibitory activity in vivo: the pressor effect of angiotensin I was significantly lower, and the response to bradykinin increased when the rats were pre-treated with either product.

Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that PepC will be effective as nutraceutical ingredient for the formulation of functional foods aimed at hypertension control."	10.1002/mnfr.201100381

Tavares, TG. et al.	The remarkable longevity of people in specific regions of Portugal, whose diets are based on whey cheese, has puzzled researchers for quite some time. Our data indicate that several oligopeptides are released from glycomacropeptide (originated in κ-casein) and α-lactalbumin – and one surprisingly from β-lactoglobulin, by plant proteases previously used in cheesemaking. A few of such peptides (e.g. DKVGINYW, KGYGGVSLPEW and DAQSAPLRVY) exhibit unusually strong antihypertensive roles in vitro, following generation in situ or synthesis de novo. The activities of the latter two are not significantly affected by simulated gastrointestinal digestion, despite undergoing partial hydrolysis. This piece of information is rather promising toward more comprehensive attempts to scientifically rationalise this Portuguese Paradox.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.09.052

Whey protein concentrate (WPC) was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by proteases from the flowers of Cynara cardunculus, and the resulting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect was monitored. The whole WPC hydrolysate exhibited an IC50 value of 52.9 ± 2.9 μg/mL, whereas the associated peptide fraction with molecular weight below 3 kDa scored 23.6 ± 1.1 μg/mL. The latter fraction was submitted to RP-HPLC, and 6 fractions were resolved that exhibited ACE-inhibitory effects. Among the various peptides found, a total of 14 were identified via sequencing with an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Eleven of these peptides were synthesized de novo – to validate their ACE-inhibitory effect, and also to ascertain their stability when exposed to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Among them, three novel, highly potent peptides were found, corresponding to α-lactalbumin f(16–26) – with the sequence KGYGGVSLPEW, α-lactalbumin f(97–104) with DKVGINYW, and β-lactoglobulin f(33–42) with DAQSAPLRVY; their IC50 values were as low as 0.80 ± 0.1, 25.2 ± 1.0 and 13.0 ± 1.0 μg/mL, respectively. None of them remained stable in the presence of gastrointestinal enzymes: they were partially, or even totally hydrolyzed to smaller peptides – yet the observed ACE-inhibitory effects were not severely affected for two of those peptides.	10.1016/j.peptides.2011.02.005

YGG	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	37-39	Immunomodulatory	Stimulated lymphocyte proliferation					Stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by bioactive peptides derived from bovine milk proteins	Kayser, H. et al.	The in vitro modulation of the proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes of different synthetic peptides derived from milk proteins was investigated. Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.	10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4
KILDKVGINYWLAHK	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	113-127	DPP-IV Inhibitory		11.4				Generation and characterization of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitorypeptides from trypsin-hydrolyzed α-lactalbumin-rich whey protein.	Jia, Cl. et al.	Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is an enzyme that break down the antidiabetic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. Therefore, inhibition of DPP-IV could be an effective strategy to treat Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The α-lactalbumin-rich whey protein concentrate was hydrolyzed by trypsin, and the hydrolysates were then fractionated at a semi-preparative scale using a Superdex Gel filtration Chromatography. The peptides were analyzed by using HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-MS/MS), and their Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory activity was determined by the enzymatic assay. Among tested fragments, a potent fragment (LDQWLCEKL), with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 131 μM was obtained. Further analysis shows that the LDQWLCEKL peptide corresponds to the amino acid sequence of f(115–123) in α-lactalbumin. Furthermore, LDQWLCEKL exhibited a typical non-competitive mode of inhibition. The results indicate that α-lactalbumin contains active peptides with DPP-IV inhibitory activity that may be used to prevent and treat T2D.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126333

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976

TTFHTSGY	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	48-55	ACE-inhibitory		142.0				 New ACE-inhibitory peptides derived from α-lactalbumin produced by hydrolysis with Bromelia antiacantha peptidases	Villadoniga, C. et al.	Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a key role in regulating blood pressure and ACE inhibitors are first-line drugs for treating hypertension. Food protein-derived peptides with ACE inhibitory activity are natural and safe alternatives for both prevention and treatment of hypertension. The second most abundant whey protein, α-lactalbumin (ALA) was hydrolysed with proteases from Bromelia antiacantha Bertol., a native plant. Two new peptides with potent ACE-inhibitory activity: TTFHTSGY (IC50 = 142 μM) and GYDTQAIVQ (IC50 = 1.0 mM) were purified by affinity chromatography and sequences were determined by mass spectrometry. In silico analysis indicated that neither of these peptides was toxic (ToxinPred). Inhibition kinetic analysis showed that TTFHTSGY was a fully functional ACE competitive inhibitor, whereas GYDTQAIVQ caused only partial ACE inhibition. Our results indicate that cysteine peptidases from B. antiacantha hydrolyse ALA to produce novel ACE inhibitory peptides that could be useful even as functional food ingredients.	10.1016/j.bcab.2019.101258

An attempt has been made to assess the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory potential of α-lactalbumin separated from milk of Gir cow. α-lactalbumin hydrolysates were prepared using three different enzymes at different enzyme-to-substrate (E:S) ratios (1:25, 1:50 and 1:100) treated for 2- to 12-h durations. Pepsin-treated hydrolysates showed maximum DPP-IV inhibition of 87.81 ± 0.84% (IC50 = 0.78 mg/mL). The permeate of 3 kDa, which exhibited 84.47 ± 2.29% DPP-IV inhibition, was fractionated through RP-HPLC. All fractions were analysed for DPP-IV inhibition activity. One novel peptide was identified through LC-MS/MS, which showed adequate DPP-IV inhibition (IC50 = 4.93 mM).	10.1111/1471-0307.12868
IWCKDDQNPH	P00711	Alpha-lactalbumin	Bos taurus	78-87	Antioxidant						Identification and characterization of antioxidant peptides obtained from the bioaccessible fraction of α-lactalbumin hydrolysate	Baez, J. et al.	Whey is an abundantand sustainable source of bioactive peptides obtained from cheese making process. Whey proteins such as α-lactalbumin can be biologically active when the bioactive peptides encrypted in the amino acid sequence of the native protein are released by enzymatic hydrolysis. In the present work, the identification, sequence analysis, and antioxidant activity of bioaccessible peptides from α-lactalbumin alcalase-hydrolysate was assessed. Antioxidant activity (ABTS, ORAC, and HORAC) of α-lactalbumin showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) after the enzymatic treatment with alcalase and this capacity increased even more after the simulation of the gastrointestinal digestion process. Peptides contained in the gastrointestinal digest of α-lactalbumin hydrolysate were separated by preparative RP-HPLC (55 fractions), and three peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis from selected fractions: IWCKDDQNPH (MW: 1254.54 Da) f(59-68), KFLDDDLTDDIM (MW: 1439.64 Da) f(79-90), DKFLDDDLTDDIM (MW: 1554.67 Da) f(78-90). Among the chemically synthesized peptides, IWCKDDQNPH showed the highest antioxidant capacity determined by ORAC, ABTS, and HORAC assays (IC50 0.015 ± 0.002, 0.45 ± 0.02, and 1.30 ± 0.05 mg/ml, respectively) and this activity may be related to the amino acid sequence. This is the first report where these bioaccessible peptides from α-lactalbumin hydrolysate were identified. The α-lactalbumin hydrolysate could be employed as a functional antioxidant ingredient.	10.1111/1750-3841.15918
ILDKEGIDY	P00710	Alpha-lactalbumin	Camelus dromedarius	95-103	DPP-IV Inhibitory		347.8				Identication  of  novel  dipeptidyl  peptidase  IV  (DPP-IV)  inhibitory  peptides  in  camel  milk  protein  hydrolysates.	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033

Pihlanto-Leppala,  A. et al.	The aim of this study was to identify whey-derived peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The bovine whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination. The total hydrolysates were fractionated in a two step ultrafiltration process, first with a 30 kDa membrane and then with a 1 kDa membrane. Inhibition of ACE was analysed spectrophotometrically. The peptides were isolated by chromatography and identified by mass and sequencing analysis. The most potent inhibitory peptides were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50 % inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345–1733 μg/ml. The IC50 values for the 1–30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 μg/ml and for the <1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77–1062 μM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were α-lactalbumin fractions (50–52), (99–108) and (104–108) and β-lactoglobulin fractions (22–25), (32–40), (81–83), (94–100), (106–111) and (142–146).	10.1017/s0022029999003982

Chen, L. et al.	A novel wild Lactobacillus plantarum 60 with strong antioxidant activity was isolated from Kefir and identified morphologically and genetically. The goat milk fermented with L60 was characterized with strong DPPH radical scavenging activity, high viable count, satisfactory acidity and good stability after gastrointestinal digestion. Fractions of L60 fermented goat milk were purified through a successive of ultrafiltration, Sephadex and Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) technologies, and evaluated by the DPPH radical assay, hydroxyl free radical assay and Fe2+ chelating ability. Three novel antioxidative peptides were obtained subsequently and identified as VGINYWLAHK, TPEVDKEALEK and DLLER. The application of purified peptides in goat milk powder showed significantly increased antioxidant capacities. Our study provided a roadmap for a more comprehensive description of the antioxidant capacity of goat milk fermented by a novel L. plantarum 60.	10.1016/j.lwt.2020.110162

Further analysis shows that the LDQWLCEKL peptide corresponds to the amino acid sequence of f(115–123) in α-lactalbumin. Furthermore, LDQWLCEKL exhibited a typical non-competitive mode of inhibition. The results indicate that α-lactalbumin contains active peptides with DPP-IV inhibitory activity that may be used to prevent and treat T2D.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126333
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory						Hemodynamic Effects of Lactotripeptides from Casein Hydrolysate in Mediterranean Normotensive Subjects and Patients with High-Normal Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Clinical Trial	Cicero, AFG. et al.	Contrasting data partially support a certain antihypertensive efficacy of lactotripeptides derived from enzymatic treatment of casein hydrolysate. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical study to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy of a short-term treatment with lactotripeptides in Mediterranean subjects with normal or high-normal blood pressure (BP). We consecutively enrolled 55 untreated subjects (men:women = 30:25), 40.3 ± 9.8 years old, with normal or high-normal BP. After 4 weeks of dietary standardization, they were allocated to treatment with a fruit juice containing 3 mg of added Ile-Pro-Pro/Val-Pro-Pro lactotripeptides or with placebo for 4 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, they were then assigned to the alternative treatment for a further period of 4 weeks. Overall, no significant difference has been observed in office BP comparing baseline data with those posttreatment. Repeating the analysis by basal BP level, a mild but significant reduction in systolic BP (−1.7 ± 2.3 mm Hg; t = 3.5, P = .002) has been observed only in subjects with high-normal BP after treatment with lactotripeptides. With regard to 24-hour BP measurement, after lactotripeptide treatment only, the subjects experienced a significant reduction in diurnal diastolic BP (−1.6 ± 5.4 mm Hg; P = .042), diurnal mean BP (−2.1 ± 5.9 mm Hg; P = .19), and 24-hour (−5.4 ± 14.2 mm Hg; P = .011) and diurnal (−7.1 ± 19.2%; P = .014) diastolic BP value measurements relative to normal values. No modification has been observed in relation to plasma renin activity and aldosteronemia. In conclusion, diurnal diastolic BP is significantly reduced by lactrotripeptide supplementation in untreated Mediterranean subjects with normal or high-normal BP. Office systolic BP is reduced only in subjects with high-normal BP.	10.1089/jmf.2009.0253
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory		8.4				ACE-inhibitory activity of probiotic yoghurt	Donkor, ON. et al.	In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory		23.9				Screening milk-derived antihypertensive peptides using quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modelling and in vitro/in vivo studies on their bioactivity	Jing, P. et al.	In this study, we constructed a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory tripeptides from published data (R2 = 0.8437; Q2 = 0.649) and applied the model to screen 27 tripeptides derived from cow milk protein sequences. Potential ACE inhibitory tripeptides were synthesised and evaluated in in vitro/in vivo studies. Results showed that ACE inhibitory activities of tripeptides followed the order (p < 0.05): isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP, commercial) > valine-isoleucine-proline (VIP) > isoleucine-valine-proline (IVP) based on concentrations (7.57–49.72 μm) that decreased 50% of ACE activity. Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) effect of tripeptides in rats (1.5 mg kg−1 body weight dosage) followed the order according to relative lowering SBP rates: IVP (24%) > IPP (17%) > VIP (12%), consistent with results on mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Mg2+ -ATPase gene in rat hearts (p < 0.05). IPP and IVP showed no negative effects on blood glycometabolism.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.10.009
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory						Characterization of casein-derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory						Biological effects of casein-derived tripeptide powders are not affected by fermentation process	Jakala, P. et al.	Milk casein-derived biologically active tripeptides isoleucine–proline–proline and valine–proline–proline have shown antihypertensive effects both in animal and clinical studies. Contradictory findings from clinical intervention studies may be related to different manufacturing processes. The present study aimed to compare cardiovascular effects of two different tripeptide powders in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Rats received tripeptide powders produced either by Lactobacillus helveticus fermentation (A) or Lb. helveticus plus proline specific endoprotease (B) in drinking fluid for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was recorded weekly. At the end, blood and tissue samples were collected and arterial responses studied. Blood pressure was 13.6 and 14.2 mmHg lower in the groups A and B, respectively, versus the water group (P < 0.01). Vascular responses of aorta and mesenteric artery did not differ between the groups. Both tripeptide products increased urinary cGMP (P < 0.001) and decreased albumin (P < 0.05). The fermentation process did not influence the cardiovascular effects of the tripeptide powders.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.11.017
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory		4.5				Antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro	Yamada, A. et al.	The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	ACE-inhibitory		9.0				Purification and Characterization of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors from Sour Milk	Nakamura, Y. et al.	The inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme in milk increased during fermentation with the Calpis sour milk starter containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two kinds of peptides inhibitory to angiotensin I-converting enzyme were purified from the sour milk by using four-step HPLC. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were identified as Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro. The concentrations of peptides providing 50% inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were 9 and 5 microM, respectively. Most of the inhibitory activity in sour milk was attributed to these two peptides.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(95)76689-9
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	Antioxidant						Milk-derived tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) differentially modulate angiotensin II effects on vascular smooth muscle cells	Chakrabarti, S. et al.	Hyperactivity of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is a hallmark of hypertension. Angiotensin II (AngII), the active component of RAS, not only promotes vasoconstriction but also contributes to proliferation, inflammation and oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that predispose to atherosclerosis. Milk derived bioactive peptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) exert anti-hypertensive effects through RAS modulation. Here we evaluated the ability of these peptides to attenuate the effects of AngII on cultured VSMC. We found that VPP significantly inhibited AngII induced cell proliferation, inflammation and oxidative stress while IPP only showed anti-oxidant actions. Both peptides abolished AngII mediated activation of pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway but only VPP could attenuate activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2. These results demonstrate differential modulation of AngII actions on VSMC by anti-hypertensive milk peptides and indicate the potential for VPP in mitigating the vascular complications of hypertension.	10.1016/j.jff.2016.12.022
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	Enhance insulin signaling						Milk-Derived Tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) Enhance Insulin Sensitivity and Prevent Insulin Resistance in 3T3-F442A Preadipocytes	Chakrabarti, S. et al.	There is great interest in developing naturally derived compounds, especially bioactive peptides with potential insulin sensitizing effects and/or preventing insulin resistance. Previously, we showed adipogenic and insulin mimetic actions of IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro), the milk-derived tripeptides on cultured preadipocytes, in addition to their previously characterized antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory functions. However, the effect of these peptides on insulin signaling is not known. Therefore, we examined IPP and VPP effects on insulin signaling in preadipocytes, a well-established model for studying insulin signaling. Our results suggested both peptides enhanced insulin signaling and contributed toward the prevention of insulin resistance in the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Inhibition of inflammatory mediator NF-kB under TNF stimulation was a likely contributor to the prevention of insulin resistance. VPP further enhanced the expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes and restored glucose uptake in TNF-treated adipocytes. Our data suggested the potential of these peptides in the management of conditions associated with impairments in insulin signaling.	10.1021/acs.jafc.8b02051
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Oral administration of the milk casein-derived tripeptide Val-Pro-Pro attenuates high-fat diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation in mice	Aihara, K. et al.	Inflammation of adipose tissue triggers the metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis and CHD. In the present study, we investigated whether the milk casein-derived tripeptide valine-proline-proline (VPP) has an anti-inflammatory effect on the adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Male C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks of age) were fed ad libitum with either a HFD and plain tap water (HFD group) or a HFD and water containing 0·3 mg VPP/ml (HFD+VPP group) for 10 weeks. The results showed that the expression level of CD18 in the peripheral blood monocytes of the HFD+VPP group was significantly decreased compared with the level observed in those of the HFD group. Activated monocytes and pro-inflammatory macrophages were accumulated in the stromal vascular fractions of the adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice, which were significantly decreased in those supplemented with VPP. The formation of crown-like structures rich in pro-inflammatory macrophages was also significantly reduced in the adipose tissue of mice administered with VPP. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and that of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in adipose tissue tend to be lower in the HFD+VPP group than in the HFD group. These observations indicate that oral administration of VPP exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on the adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice, which may eventually lead to the primary prevention of chronic inflammation-related diseases.	10.1017/S0007114514001147

VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Milk-Derived Tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) Promote Adipocyte Differentiation and Inhibit Inflammation in 3T3-F442A Cells	Chakrabarti, S. et al.	Milk derived tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) have shown promise as anti-hypertensive agents due to their inhibitory effects on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Due to the key inter-related roles of hypertension, chronic inflammation and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, there is growing interest in investigating established anti-hypertensive agents for their effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation. In this study, we examined the effects of IPP and VPP on 3T3-F442A murine pre-adipocytes, a widely used model for studying metabolic diseases. We found that both IPP and VPP induced beneficial adipogenic differentiation as manifested by intracellular lipid accumulation, upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and secretion of the protective lipid hormone adiponectin by these cells. The observed effects were similar to those induced by insulin, suggesting potential benefits in the presence of insulin resistance. IPP and VPP also inhibited cytokine induced pro-inflammatory changes such as reduction in adipokine levels and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that IPP and VPP exert insulin-mimetic adipogenic effects and prevent inflammatory changes in adipocytes, which may offer protection against metabolic disease	10.1371/journal.pone.0117492

Lactobacillus (L.) helveticus fermented milk attenuates the development of hypertension through its bioactive peptides. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether L. helveticus and its components affect bone in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHR (n = 10/group) received either 1) L. helveticus fermented milk high in isoleucyl-prolyl-proline (IPP) and valyl-prolyl-proline (VPP) peptides, 2) normal sour milk, 3) synthesised IPP and VPP peptides in water, or 4) water, ad libitum for 12 weeks. After the intervention, bone mineral density and bone mineral content were measured of the right femur by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Ash weight, and calcium and phosphate content of the ashes were measured. Static histomorphometrical measurements were taken from the tibia. The L. helveticus group showed 34% higher bone volume than the water group (p = 0.066). The trabecular thickness was 17% higher in the L. helveticus group (p = 0.025) and 10% higher in the peptide group (p = 0.025) than in the water group. There was no difference in the bone mineral density between the L. helveticus and the water group. Long-term feeding with L. helveticus fermented milk supports trabecular bone in growing SHR. This effect may be dependent on the bioactive peptides formed during fermentation.	N/A
VPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	99-101	Osteoanabolic	Reduces bone loss					Effects of Bioactive Peptide, Valyl-Prolyl-Proline (VPP), and Lactobacillus helveticus Fermented Milk Containing VPP on Bone Loss in Ovariectomized Rats	Narva, M. et al.	Valyl-prolyl-proline (VPP), a bioactive peptide formed during the fermentation with Lactobacillus helveticus LBK-16H (L. helveticus), has been shown to increase bone formation in vitro. The aim of the study was to determine whether VPP and L. helveticus fermented milk prevent bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Methods: During the 12-week intervention study, the OVX rats received VPP in water or L. helveticus fermented milk, containing VPP. Sham-operated rats receiving water acted as controls. The trabecular and cortical bone mineral density were determined by peripheral quantitative computed tomography before the operation and at 4 and 12 weeks. The mechanical testing and ash weight analysis as well as the static and dynamic histomorphometrical parameters were assessed at the end of the intervention. Results: VPP given in water showed no clear effect on bone loss. L. helveticus fermented milk prevented bone loss by decreasing bone turnover and increasing the bone mineral density. Ovariectomycaused a 57% loss in the trabecular bone, which was attenuated by 16% in the L. helveticus group. Conclusions: VPP peptide did not prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss, which could be due to the poor bioavailability of VPP from water solution. L. helveticus fermented milk prevented bone loss, whether this is due to the VPP peptide cannot be concluded.	10.1159/000100823

YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	ACE-inhibitory		685.91				In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	ACE-inhibitory		500.0				Release of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides by simulated gastrointestinal digestion of infant formulas	Hernandez-Ledesma, B. et al.	The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of several infant formulas was evaluated. Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Antianxiety						Comparative analysis of neurotropic activity of exorphines, derivatives of dietary proteins	Dubynin, VA. et al.	The effects of wheat gluten fragments, hemoglobin, and milk β-caseins (exorphine C, hemorphine-6, and β-casomorphine-7) on nociceptive sensitivity and behavior were studied in albino rats. Hemorphine-6 and exorphine C induced hyperalgesia and increased anxiety; β-casomorphine-7 decreased anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. All peptides partially decreased motor activity and the orientative-exploring reaction. In contrast to β-casomorphine-7, exorphine C and hemorphine-6 did not exhibit neurotropic activity intrinsic to opioids and can be characterized as functional antagonists of endogenous opioid peptides.	10.1007/BF02496839
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Antioxidant	Reduces pancreas MDA level					β-Casomorphin-7 Cause Decreasing in Oxidative Stress and Inhibiting NF-kappaB-iNOS-NO Signal Pathway in Pancreas of Diabetes Rats	Yin, H. et al.	β-Casomorphin-7 (β-CM-7) is a milk biological active peptide. The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Immunomodulatory	induce inflammatory immune response in gut					Consumption of β-casomorphins-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in mice gut through Th-2 pathway	Ul Haq, MR. et al.	β-Casomorphins are opioid like bioactive peptides released on digestion of β-casein of milk. In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Increase mucin secretion	prevents naloxone mucus inhibition					Milk Bioactive Peptides and -Casomorphins Induce Mucus Release in Rat Jejunum	Trompette, A. et al.	Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	10.1093/jn/133.11.3499 
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Increase mucin secretion						Effects of peptides derived from dietary proteins on mucus secretion in rat jejunum	Claustre, J. et al.	The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins. On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.	10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC expression					β-Casomorphin-7 regulates the secretion and expression of gastrointestinal mucins through a u-opioid pathway	Zoghbi, S. et al.	We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.	10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Opioid						Biologically active peptides in milk proteins	Meisel, H. et al.	Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.	10.1007/BF02019390
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Opioid						Food-Derived Peptides Stimulate Mucin Secretion and Gene Expression in Intestinal Cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k

Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011
YPFPGPI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Satiety	induces CCK-8 (satiety)					In vitro transport and satiety of a β-lactoglobulin dipeptide and β-casomorphin-7 and its metabolites	Osborne, S. et al.	Understanding the digestive behaviour and biological activities of dairy proteins may help to develop model dairy products with targeted health outcomes including increased satiety and healthy weight maintenance. Caseins and whey proteins constitute over 95% of milk proteins with consumption of these proteins associated with increased satiety and a decreased prevalence of metabolic disorders. To investigate the in vitro digestive behaviour and satiety of dairy proteins at the intestinal epithelium, the in vitro transport and hydrolysis of 500–2000 μM β-casomorphin-7 (YPFPGPI or β-CM7) and a β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) dipeptide (YL) was measured using Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on transwells as a model of the intestinal epithelium. Transport of YL was concentration dependent and ranged from 0.37–5.26 × 10−6 cm s−1, whereas transport of β-CM7 was only detected at 2000 μM and was significantly lower at 0.13 × 10−6 cm s−1. Rapid hydrolysis of β-CM7 in the apical chamber by the Caco-2 cells produced three peptide metabolites: YP, GPI and FPGPI. All of these metabolites were detected in the basolateral chamber after 30 min with both the YP and GPI peptides transporting at a higher rate than intact β-CM7. In vitro satiety was indicated by the secretion of cholecystokinin [26–33] (CCK-8) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-17–36NH2) in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell model. CCK-8 secretion was highest in response to β-CM7 followed by the β-CM7 metabolite FPGPI. CCK-8 secretion however was not significantly stimulated by the tri- or dipeptides. Secretion of GLP-1 was not significantly stimulated by β-CM7 or YL. These in vitro results suggest that dairy peptide size enhances CCK-8 secretion, whilst limiting transport across Caco-2 monolayers.	10.1039/c4fo00164h
GVSKVKEAMAPKHKEMPFPKYPVEPFTESQ	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	109-138	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC4 expression; Increase small intestinal goblet cell density					A novel bioactive peptide from yoghurts modulates expression of the gel-forming MUC2 mucin as well as population of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine	Plaisancie, P. et al.	Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004

We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533

Scope

β-casofensin, also known as peptide β-CN(94-123), is a milk bioactive peptide that modulates the intestinal barrier through its action on goblet cells. Here, we evaluated whether oral administration of β-casofensin can prevent indomethacin-induced injury of the jejunum in rats.
Methods and results

Rats received β-casofensin (0.01–100 μM) or tap water by daily gavage (4 μL/g) for eight days, then two subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (10 mg/kg, days 9 and 10) and were euthanized on day 12. In vitro, we investigated the effects of β-casofensin on the restitution of a wounded monolayer. Preventive administration of β-casofensin (100 μM) reduced intestinal macroscopic and microscopic damage induced by indomethacin. β-casofensin also prevented the depletion of goblet cells and increased myeloperoxidase activity, as well as tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ) expression and immunostaining of active caspase-3 in the jejunum of rats treated with indomethacin. In wound healing experiments, β-casofensin promoted epithelial restitution with no effect on cell proliferation. This effect was inhibited by pre-incubation with an anti-CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) neutralizing antibody.
Conclusions

β-casofensin exerts protective effects in indomethacin-induced enteritis through preservation of goblet cells and improvement in wound healing. β-casofensin could therefore become vital in nutritional programs for the prevention of intestinal diseases."	10.1002/mnfr.201500680
YPFPG	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-79	Anticancer						Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1

In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018

Endogenous opioid peptides and opiate drugs are known to affect the development of the nervous system. β-Casomorphins (β-CMs) belong to a family of exogenous opioid peptides derived from the milk protein β-casein by proteolytic fragmentation. We investigated the effects of various fragments and analogues of β-CM on neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. The fragments β-CM-5 to -9 and β-CM-5 amide stimulated neurite outgrowth. Fragments shorter than β-CM-5 (β-CM-3, -4, and β-CM-4 amide) and longer than β-CM-9 (β-CM-13 and -21) had no effects. The activity of β-CMs to promote neurite outgrowth does not correlate with their opioid activity in guinea-pig ileum. The effect of the most potent fragment, β-CM-5, was prevented by the μ-opioid receptor-selectiveantagonist D-Phe-Cys2-Tyr3-D-Trp-Orn5-Thr6-Pen7- Thr8-NH2 (CTOP), or by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of β-CMs on neurite outgrowth were mediated through G protein-coupled μ-opioid receptors.	10.1271/bbb.67.2541
YPFPG	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-79	Improves cognition	improves learning and memory					Effects of systemic administration of β-casomorphin-5 on learning and memory in mice	Sakaguchi, M. et al.	The effects of systemic administration of bovine β-casomorphin-5 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly), a μ-opioid receptor agonist derived from milk β-casein, on spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze (spatial short-term memory) and step-down-type passive avoidance response (non-spatial long-term memory) were investigated in mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of β-casomorphin-5 (0.1–20 mg/kg) did not have a significant effect on either spontaneous alternation behavior or passive avoidance response. However, a low dose (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of β-casomorphin-5 improved scopolamine (1 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior and passive avoidance response. Pretreatment with intracerebroventricular injections of β-funaltrexamine (a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, 0.1 μg/mouse) and naloxonazine (a μ1-opioid antagonist, 5 μg/mouse), which did not improve scopolamine-induced impairment, prevented the ameliorating effect of β-casomorphin-5 on scopolamine-induced impairment of passive avoidance response. These results indicated that systemic administration of a low dose (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of β-casomorphin-5 improves the disturbance of learning and memory resulting from cholinergic dysfunction through central mediation involving μ1-opioid receptors.	10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.11.014
YPFPG	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-79	Increase intestinal motility						An in vitro rat model of colonic motility to determine the effect of β-casomorphin-5 on propagating contractions	Dalziel, J E. et al.	Beta-casomorphin-5 (βCM-5) is a milk-derived bioactive peptide that slows gastro-intestinal transit (GIT) in vivo and blocks the peristaltic reflex in the guinea pig colon in vitro. We wanted to establish an in vitro model system in which effects of dairy-derived substances containing opioid peptides on intestinal motility can be assessed and used to predict in vivo outcomes. Because βCM-5 is an opioid agonist that acts on enteric neurons, we used this substance to compare two different isolated colonic tissue preparations to determine which would more closely mimic the in vivo response previously reported in the literature. We compared and characterized the effects of βCM-5 on spontaneous contractions in isolated segments of distal colon (1 cm length) compared with propagating contractions along the isolated intact large intestine (22 cm length). In short segments of distal colon, βCM-5 increased the tension and frequency of spontaneous contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. At 20 μM βCM-5 tension increased by 71 ± 17% and the frequency doubled (n = 9), effects inhibited by naloxone (n = 7) and therefore mediated by opioid receptors. In contrast 20 μM βCM-5 disrupted propagating contractions in the large intestine preparation. At 20 μM βCM-5 reduced the proportion of contractions initiated in the proximal colon reaching the rectum by 83 ± 11% (n = 5) and this effect was also inhibited by naloxone, consistent with altered GIT reported in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the isolated whole large intestine provides an ideal preparation that mimics the reduced propagation of GIT in vivo in response to an opioid agonist, whereas short colon segments did not. The findings of the current study reveal that preserving large segments of intact large intestine, and hence intact enteric neural circuitry provides an ideal in vitro model to investigate the effect of opioid receptor modulators on intestinal transit.	10.1039/c4fo00193a

Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011

IHPFAQTQ	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	64-71	Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory						Biologically active peptides in milk proteins	Meisel, H. et al.	Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.	10.1007/BF02019390

YPVEPF	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Antimicrobial						Two New Secreted Proteases Generate a Casein derived Antimicrobial Peptide in Bacillus cereus Food Born Isolate Leading to Bacterial Competition in Milk	Ouertani, A. et al.	Milk and dairy products harbor a wide variety of bacterial species that compete for both limited resources and space. Under these competitive conditions, bacteria develop specialized mechanisms to protect themselves during niche colonization and nutrient acquisition processes. The bacterial antagonism mechanisms include the production of antimicrobial agents or molecules that facilitate competitor dispersal. In the present work, a bacterial strain designated RC6 was isolated from Ricotta and identified as Bacillus cereus. It generates antimicrobial peptide (AMP) when grown in the presence of casein. The AMP was active against several species of Bacillus and Listeria monocytogenes. MALDI-TOF analysis of the RP-HPLC purified fractions and amino acid sequencing revealed a molecular mass of 751 Da comprised of a 6-residue sequence, YPVEPF. BLAST analysis showed that the AMP corresponds to the fractions 114–119 of bovine β-casein and represents the product of a specific proteolysis. Analysis of the purified proteolytic fractions from the B. cereus RC6 culture supernatant indicated that the presence of at least two different endoproteases is crucial for the generation of the AMP. Indeed, we were able to identify two new candidate endoproteases by means of genome sequencing and functional assignment using a 3D structural model and molecular docking of misannotated hypothetical proteins. In this light, the capacity of B. cereus RC6 to generate antimicrobial peptides from casein, through the production of extracellular enzymes, presents a new model of antagonistic competition leading to niche colonization. Hence, as a dairy product contaminant, this strategy may enable proteolytic B. cereus RC6 niche specialization in milk matrices.	10.3389/fmicb.2018.01148
YPVEPF	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991
YPVEPF	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	DPP-IV Inhibitory		138.0				Identiï¬cation of novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides in camel milk protein hydrolysates	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033
YPVEPF	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	DPP-IV Inhibitory		124.7				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005
YPVEPF	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC4 expression					β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533
YPVEPF	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Opioid						Enzymatic release of neocasomorphin and  β-casomorphin from bovine  β-casein	Jinsmaa, Y.den. et al.	Conditions for the release of β-casomorphin-7 from bovine β-casein by gastrointestinal proteases in vitro were investigated. β-Casomorphin-7 was released only from a genetic variant of β-casein containing a His residue at the 67th position of the peptide chain. Elastase cleaved the peptide bond between Ile66 and His67, releasing the carboxyl terminus of β-casomorphin-7. Pepsin and leucine aminopeptidase were required to release the amino terminus of this peptide. β-Casomorphin-9, -13, and -21 also were isolated, and their opioid activities were measured. In this study, we also isolated a novel opioid peptide neocasomorphin-6 (Tyr-Pro-Val-Glu-Pro-Phe), which was released by action of trypsin or pepsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1016/s0196-9781(99)00088-1

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1
YPFVEPI	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304

YPFVE	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-70	Increase mucin secretion						Food-Derived Peptides Stimulate Mucin Secretion and Gene Expression in Intestinal Cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k
YPFPGP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-80	DPP-IV Inhibitory		749.2				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005
YPFPGP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-80	Opioid						Biologically active peptides in milk proteins	Meisel, H. et al.	Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.	10.1007/BF02019390
YPFP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-78	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1

YPFP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-78	Opioid						Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel peripherally active morphiceptin analogs	Gach, K. et al.	Morphiceptin (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-NH2), a tetrapeptide present in the enzymatic digest of bovine β-casein, is a selective ligand of the μ-opioid receptor. In the present study, we describe the synthesis of a series of novel morphiceptin analogs modified in positions 1–3. Two of the obtained analogs, [Dmt1, d-Ala2, d-1-Nal3]morphiceptin and [Dmt1, d-NMeAla2, d-1-Nal3]morphiceptin (Dmt—2′,6′-dimethyltyrosine and d-1-Nal—3-(1-naphthyl)-d-alanine)) displayed very high μ-receptor affinity, resistance to enzymatic degradation, and remarkable supraspinally mediated analgesia, as shown in the hot-plate test after intracerebroventricular but not intravenous administration, which indicated that they could not cross the blood–brain barrier. Therefore, these two analogs were further tested in vitro and in vivo towards their possible peripheral analgesic activity and inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal (GI) motility. We report that both peptides showed strong antinociceptive effect in the writhing test after intraperitoneal administration, inhibited smooth muscle contractility in vitro and GI motility in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that the novel morphiceptin analogs which induce peripheral, but not central antinociception, inhibit GI transit, and possess exceptional metabolic stability, may provide an interesting approach to the development of peripherally restricted agents for the treatment of GI motility disorders, such as diarrhea or diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.	10.1016/j.peptides.2010.04.018
EMPFPK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	ACE-inhibitory		565.58				Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides Derived from Bovine Milk Proteins	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X
EMPFPK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	Antimicrobial				Gram negative		Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019
EMPFPK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	Bradykinin-Potentiating						Biochemical and Pharmacological Aspects of Two Bradykinin-Potentiating Peptides Obtained from Tryptic Hydrolysis of Casein	Perpetuo, EA. et al.	Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff
EMPFPK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC4 expression					β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533
YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	ACE-inhibitory		101.0				Antihypertensive Effect of the Peptides Derived from Casein by an Extracellular Proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790	Yamamoto, N. et al.	Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0
YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Anticancer						Antioxidant peptides isolated from synbiotic yoghurt exhibit antiproliferative activities against HT-29 colon cancer cells	B.N.P. Sah. et al.	Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003
YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli		Antimicrobial activity of two peptides casecidin 15 and 17, found naturally in bovine colostrum	Birkemo, GA. et al.	"Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum."	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x
YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Antithrombotic						Antithrombotic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of peptides released from bovine casein by Lactobacillus casei Shirota	Rojas-Ronquillo, R. et al.	Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antithrombotic properties of peptides released from bovine caseins during fermentation by Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus were determined. Both species released ACE inhibitory peptides, whereas only Lb. casei Shirota produced antithrombotic activity. The highest thrombin inhibitory activity, 80.7%, was observed at 27 h of fermentation by Lb. casei Shirota. Active peptides were purified by HPLC; seven peptides were obtained, and their resistance to digestive enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, was evaluated. The most active peptide even after the hydrolysis was identified as YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV (fragment 193–209 of β-casein): it had an inhibition efficiency ratio for ACE of 0.14%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1), and a thrombin inhibition efficiency ratio of 4.6%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1). This peptide had been previously reported as an ACE-inhibitor, but this is the first time that it is evaluated for its thrombin inhibition activity.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.05.002
YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Immunomodulatory	Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages					A peptide derived from bovine β-casein modulates functional properties of bone marrow-derived macrophages from germfree and human flora-associated mice	Sandre, C. et al.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of a peptide derived from bovine beta-casein (beta-CN), the beta-CN (193-209) peptide, on mouse macrophages that were obtained either from germfree (GF) or from human flora-associated (HF) mice. Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.	10.1093/jn/131.11.2936 
QEPVL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	209-213	Immunomodulatory						Immunomodulating effects of casein-derived peptides QEPVL and QEPV on lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo	Jiehui, Z. et al.	Lymphocytes serve an important function in mediating specific immune responses. When the body is stimulated by internal or external antigens, activated lymphocytes proliferate to clear pathogens by secreting antibodies or cytokines. Some bioactive peptides were isolated from fermented milk in previous studies. One of the peptides, Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu (QEPVL), was synthesized and used in this experiment. Results show that QEPVL can significantly activate lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo. QEPVL can also increase the lymphocyte proliferation rate and cyclic AMP levels. This positive regulation had a dose–effect relationship within certain concentration ranges. QEPVL can also inhibit LPS-induced inflammation by regulating nitric oxide release and the production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in vivo. Digesting QEPVL in artificial gastrointestinal juice yields the digestion product Gln-Glu-Pro-Val (QEPV), which exhibits bioactivities similar to those of QEPVL in vitro. Overall, QEPVL has significant immunomodulating effects on lymphocytes and contributes to inflammation treatment through the oral route as a functional food ingredient.	10.1039/c3fo60657k

PGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	ACE-inhibitory						Characterization of casein-derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976
PGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	Anticancer	Inhibits SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell growth					PGPIPN, a Therapeutic Hexapeptide, Suppressed Human Ovarian Cancer Growth by Targeting BCL2	Wang, W. et al.	Bioactive peptides, either derived from nature resources or synthesized by rational design, have been demonstrated potential for therapeutic agents against numerous human diseases, including cancer. However, the mechanism of therapeutic peptides against cancer has not been well elucidated. Here we show that PGPIPN, a hexapeptide derived from bovine β-casein, inhibited the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells line SKOV3 as well as the primary ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Consistently, PGPIPIN also decreased tumor growth rate in xenograft ovarian cancer model mice in a dose-dependent manner. Further study demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of PGPIPN is partially through promoting cell apoptosis by inhibiting BCL2 pathway. Thus, our study suggests that PGPIPN is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer or other types of cancer.	10.1371/journal.pone.0060701
PGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	Anticancer						Bioactive Hexapeptide Reduced the Resistance of Ovarian Cancer Cells to DDP by Affecting HSF1-HSP70 Signaling Pathway	Ruowen, G. et al.	Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in gynecologic malignancies. Ovarian cancer as a metastatic malignant tumor is highly recurrent and prone to drug resistance. Bioactive peptides are an emerging area of biomedical research in reducing resistance of tumor cell to drugs. In this paper, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of bioactive hexapeptide (PGPIPN) derived in milk protein on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (DDP). Human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and COC1), their DDP-resistant sublines (SKOV3/DDP and COC1/DDP) and human primary ovarian cancer cells were cultured in vitro under the combined treatment of DDP (close to IC50) and different concentrations of PGPIPN. The viabilities, apoptosis and cell cycle changes were respectively measured by WST-8 and flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HSF1, HSP70, MDR1, ERCC1 and β-actin gene were respectively assayed by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results showed that PGPIPN significantly increased the sensitivity of human ovarian cancer cells to DDP in inhibiting viability and inducing apoptosis in vitro. But the effects in sensitive cells were lower than DDP-resistant cells. PGPIPN significantly changed the cell cycles in all human ovarian cancer cells, which leaded to a significant increase in the percentage of cells blocked at G2/M phase and decrease the percentage of cells at G1 phases in a dose-dependent manner. PGPIPN affected the expression levels of HSF1, HSP70, MDR1 and ERCC1 genes. Compared with cells in DDP treatment alone, the expression levels of HSF1 and HSP70 in human ovarian cancer cells treated with DDP and PGPIPN together significantly decreased in dose-dependent manner. PGPIPN significantly decreased MDR1 and ERCC1 of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and human primary ovarian cancer cell in a dose-dependent manner. Pifithrin-μ (PFTμ, HSP70 inhibitor) decreased or removed the effects of peptide in increasing the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to DDP. This suggests that PGPIPN enhanced the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to DDP partially via reducing the activity of HSF1/HSP70 signaling pathway, thus inducing cell apoptosis and decreasing repairment of DNA damage.	10.7150/jca.62285 
PGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	Immunomodulatory	prevents and attenuates acute alcoholic liver injury					Milk-derived hexapeptide PGPIPN prevents and attenuates acute alcoholic liver injury in mice by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress	Xu, Q. et al.	Bioactive peptides are an emerging area of biomedical research in the study of numerous human diseases, including acute alcoholic liver injury (AALI). To study the role and mechanism of the milk‑derived hexapeptide Pro‑Gly‑Pro‑Ile‑Pro‑Asn (PGPIPN) in preventing and reducing AALI, the present study established a mouse model of AALI. PGPIPN was used as a therapeutic drug, and glutathione (GSH) was used as a positive control. The body and liver weights of mice were measured, and the liver indexes were calculated to observe mice health. The pathological morphology of liver tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined to analyze hepatic injury, and hepatocyte apoptosis was measured with a TUNEL assay. The concentrations or activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6, triglyceride, total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase (GSH‑PX) were detected in serum and/or liver homogenates. The 78 kDa glucose‑regulated protein (GRP78), protein kinase R‑like (PKR) endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phosphorylated (p)‑PERK, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF‑2α), p-eIF-2α, inositol‑requiring enzyme 1α (IRE‑1α), spliced X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1s), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑3 proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes were assessed by western blotting, and RNA levels of XBP‑1s, CHOP and caspase‑3 genes were assessed by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The results suggested that PGPIPN attenuated alcoholic hepatocyte damage in animal models and reduced hepatocyte oxidative stress in a dose‑dependent manner. Moreover, PGPIPN reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress by regulating the expression levels of p‑PERK, p‑eIF‑2α, XBP‑1s, CHOP, caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑3. Collectively, the present results indicated that PGPIPN, as a potential therapeutic drug for AALI, exerted a protective effect on the liver and could reduce liver damage.	10.3892/ijmm.2020.4643
PGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Characterization of casein derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976
PGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	Immunomodulatory						Casein, a prohormone with an immunomodulating role for the newborn	Migliore-Samour, D. et al.	Maternal colostrum and milk, the earliest food of the newborn, should not only be considered as supplying nutrients, but also as agents providing protection against aggressions from the new environment. Indeed by enzymatic digestion of the main milk proteins, the caseins, biologically active peptides are released; they may be implicated in the stimulation of the newborn's immune system. From this point of view a ‘strategic active zone’ has been characterized in β-casein. A possible role of casein as a ‘prohormone’ for the newborn is suggested.	10.1007/BF01941703

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2

YPFPGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-83	DPP-IV Inhibitory		670.0				Isolation and identification of casein-derived dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory peptide LPQNIPPL from gouda-type cheese and its effect on plasma glucose in rats	Uenishi, H. et al.	A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002
VPGEIVE	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	23-29	DPP-IV Inhibitory		224.5				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005
VLGP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	212-215	ACE-inhibitory		153.5				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
VLGP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	212-215	DPP-IV Inhibitory		580.4				Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) by proline containing casein-derived peptides	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Dipeptides with a C terminal Pro inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a key enzyme in incretin hormone processing. It was hypothesised that tri- and tetrapeptides with a proline at the C-terminus may also be DPP-IV inhibitors. Therefore, an in silico hydrolysis approach was used to release short (4 ⩽ amino acids) C terminal Pro peptides from the individual caseins which constitute Pro rich substrates. This was achieved using theoretical digestion of caseins with a prolyl oligopeptidase activity. Fifteen peptides were subsequently selected for in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory analysis. Stability of these peptides to gastrointestinal enzymes was also evaluated in silico and the predicted breakdown peptides were assessed for their DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential. New DPP-IV inhibitors were identified, the most potent being Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (IC50 65.3 ± 3.5 μM). A low in vitro antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging) activity was also associated with the peptides studied. The strategy presented highlights the utility of employing an in silico approach for the prediction of food-derived peptides with a potential role in glycaemic management for subsequent development of functional foods.	10.1016/j.jff.2013.09.012

New dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-inhibitory peptides from trypsin/chymotrypsin-treated goat milk casein hydrolysates were isolated and identified by two-dimensional silica thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) combined to nano LC–MS/MS. 2D-TLC with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (2:2:1) and n-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1) as the first- and second-dimension eluents, respectively, in analytical and semipreparative scales, was set up and verified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP–HPLC) to be feasible and efficient to separate the hydrolysates. Five new DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, four relatively large oligopeptides (MHQPPQPL, SPTVMFPPQSVL, VMFPPQSVL, and INNQFLPYPY), and AWPQYL were identified, and INNQFLPYPY showed a notable IC50 value of 40.08 μM as an uncompetitive inhibitor. Interactive effects on DPP-IV inhibition were also observed among separated fractions and pure synthetic peptide mixtures with concentration-dependent activity. The study gives new insights into goat casein hydrolysates with identified DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides efficiently isolated by 2D-TLC, which provides a simple and cost-efficient separation process and is compatible with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) identification.	10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03062

MHQPPQPL	P33048	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	159-166	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085

LPQ	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	85-87	DPP-IV Inhibitory		82.0				Isolation and identification of casein-derived dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory peptide LPQNIPPL from gouda-type cheese and its effect on plasma glucose in rats	Uenishi, H. et al.	A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002
LPLPLL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	150-155	ACE-inhibitory						Novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from protease hydrolysates of Qula casein Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling and molecular docking study	Lin, K. et al.	Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008
LPLPLL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	150-155	DPP-IV Inhibitory		371.5				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005

In silico digestion of milk protein-derived peptides with gastrointestinal enzyme activities was used to predict the release of peptides with a Pro residue at position 2 from the N terminus. These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.097

GPFPILV	P33048	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	216-222	ACE-inhibitory		424.0				Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Activity of Peptides Derived from Caprine Kefir	Quiros, A. et al.	In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0
GPFPILV	P33048	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	216-222	DPP-IV Inhibitory		163.0				Comparison of dipeptidyl peptidase IV-inhibitory activity of peptides from bovine and caprine milk casein by in silico and in vitro analyses	Zhang, Y. et al.	The different potential for release of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-inhibitory peptides from bovine and caprine milk casein was assessed by in silico analysis and in vitro proteolytic assays. The former predicted a weakly higher potency for caprine casein than bovine as a precursor of DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, although with markedly diverse potential for individual caseins. This was verified by protease hydrolysis; trypsin-treated casein hydrolysates (TCAHs) displayed the strongest bioactivity. Fractionation of caprine TCAHs revealed slightly, but significantly, higher inhibitory activity in peptides <5 kDa, and notably greater efficiency in the >5 kDa fraction, than their bovine counterparts. Through in silico trypsin hydrolysis and peptides synthesis, four novel caprine casein-derived DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, including GPFPILV and HPINHR (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 163.7 ± 1.33 and 452.2 ± 7.15 μm, respectively), were found. This study corroborates the weak superiority of caprine casein over bovine in release of DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, and identifies several novel caprine casein-derived DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.10.001

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes.

FLQP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	102-105	ACE-inhibitory		68.7				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
FLQP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	102-105	DPP-IV Inhibitory		65.3				Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) by proline containing casein-derived peptides	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Dipeptides with a C terminal Pro inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a key enzyme in incretin hormone processing. It was hypothesised that tri- and tetrapeptides with a proline at the C-terminus may also be DPP-IV inhibitors. Therefore, an in silico hydrolysis approach was used to release short (4 ⩽ amino acids) C terminal Pro peptides from the individual caseins which constitute Pro rich substrates. This was achieved using theoretical digestion of caseins with a prolyl oligopeptidase activity. Fifteen peptides were subsequently selected for in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory analysis. Stability of these peptides to gastrointestinal enzymes was also evaluated in silico and the predicted breakdown peptides were assessed for their DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential. New DPP-IV inhibitors were identified, the most potent being Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (IC50 65.3 ± 3.5 μM). A low in vitro antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging) activity was also associated with the peptides studied. The strategy presented highlights the utility of employing an in silico approach for the prediction of food-derived peptides with a potential role in glycaemic management for subsequent development of functional foods.	10.1016/j.jff.2013.09.012
EPVLGPVRGP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	210-219	Cytomodulatory						Characterization of a bioactive peptide with cytomodulatory effect released from casein	Zhao, HF. et al.	To obtain a bioactive peptide released from casein and investigate the cytomodulatory effect of this bioactive peptide, Lactobacillus helveticus CICC 22171, isolated from traditional Chinese dairy product, was directly used to hydrolyze casein (5 %) at 37 C for 48 h. Ultrafiltration, Sephadex column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography were used to purify the peptide. After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP. It belonged to a fragment of β-casein (β-CN, f210–219).	10.1007/s00217-013-2106-7

YPVEPFTE	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-136	Bradykinin-Potentiating						Biochemical and Pharmacological Aspects of Two Bradykinin-Potentiating Peptides Obtained from Tryptic Hydrolysis of Casein	Perpetuo, EA. et al.	Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff

WSVPQPK	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	169-175	ACE-inhibitory		667.96				Identification of bioactive peptides after digestion of human milk and infant formula with pepsin and pancreatin	Hernandez-Ledesma, B. et al.	Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012

The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012
VYPFPGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	74-83	ACE-inhibitory		325.0				Bioactive peptides generated in an enzyme membrane reactor using Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase	Eisele, T. et al.	Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5

VYPFPGPIPN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	74-83	Antioxidant						Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	Tonolo, F. et al.	Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117
VPYPQ	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	184-188	Antioxidant						Novel anti-oxidative peptides from enzymatic digestion of human milk	Tsopmo, A. et al.	Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146
VPYPQ	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	184-188	DPP-IV Inhibitory		41.45				In Vitro Metabolic Stability of a Casein-Derived Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) Inhibitory Peptide VPYPQ and Its Controlled Release from Casein by Enzymatic Hydrolysis	L.Zheng. et al.	The aim of this study was to investigate the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibition and metabolic stability of a casein-derived peptide Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln (VPYPQ) and its fragments as well as their release from casein following hydrolysis. Results showed that VPYPQ was the most potent DPP-IV inhibitory peptide among them with an IC50 value of 41.45 μM. This might be due to its two internal Pro residues at positions 2 and 4. Moreover, VPYPQ was resistant to hydrolysis by gastrointestinal enzymes and was relatively more stable to hydrolysis by DPP-IV and peptidases in plasma compared with its fragments. Additionally, oral administration of VPYPQ at a dose of 90 μmol/kg body weight could reduce the postprandial blood glucose levels in mice. More importantly, VPYPQ could be released efficiently from casein following hydrolysis by a combination of papain and in vitro digestion, reaching up to 3211.15 μg/g. Therefore, VPYPQ was a promising casein-derived DPP-IV inhibitor.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03164
VPKVK	P11839	Beta-casein	Ovis aries	110-114	ACE-inhibitory		4.3				Bioactive Peptides in Ovine and Caprine Cheeselike Systems Prepared with Proteases from Cynara cardunculus	Silva, SV. et al.	The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)–inhibitory and antioxidant activities of peptides in water-soluble extracts, obtained from raw and sterilized ovine and caprine cheeselike systems coagulated with enzymes from the plant Cynara cardunculus, were assessed. Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0

VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	ACE-inhibitory		15.0				Transepithelial transport of milk derived bioactive peptide VLPVPQK	Vij, R. et al.	The transepithelial transport of an antioxidative and ACE inhibitory peptide, VLPVPQK (named peptide C) derived from casein hydrolysates was investigated along with extensively studied opioid peptide β-casomorphin using a human intestinal cell (Caco-2) monolayer. The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antiapoptotic effect						 Anti-apoptotic effect of buffalo milk casein-derived bioactive peptide by directing Nrf2 regulation in starving fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Starvation conditions cause cell injury or ulcers from reactive oxygen species generation and, ultimately, lead to cell death or apoptosis. Milk has many bioactive peptides with cytoprotective potential. One such peptide is the buffalo milk β-casein derived antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. It was found to have cytoprotective action during oxidative stress. However, the protective role of the peptide in natural aging induced apoptosis has not been studied. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide was analyzed by establishing an in vitro model of skin fibroblast cells with serum starved conditions similar to aging. Cell survivability and cytotoxicity were measured using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Cell death rate was determined using propidium iodide staining. In addition, gene level expression of anti-apoptotic markers’ such as Nrf2, Keap-1, Bcl-2, Bax and HO-1 were analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR. While nuclear transmigration of Nrf2 at the protein level was analyzed using western blots. The peptide treatment led to inhibition of cell death as observed using PI, DCFH-DA staining and improvement in cell survival through the activation of transcription factor, Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 stimulated the expression of cytoprotective signals from HO-1. Moreover, the peptide augmented the cellular protection by inhibiting the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1), pro-apoptotic markers (Bax) and stimulating anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression. In addition, a pronounced reduction in the activity of the cell injury marker, LDH was observed. Hence, this study showed that the antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK also showed an anti-apoptotic effect.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100566
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antimicrobial				Gram negative		Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antioxidant						Antioxidative peptide derived from enzymatic digestion of buffalo casein	Shanmugam, VP. et al.	Bioactive peptides have been defined as specific protein fragments that have a positive impact on body functions or conditions and may ultimately influence health. We scrutinised the antioxidative property of peptides from buffalo casein digested with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin alone and in combinations. Casein hydrolysates were subjected to ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The antioxidant properties of casein, its hydrolysates and synthetic peptides, was assessed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The fraction with highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was selected for further study. TEAC of casein was 0.862 ± 0.11 μmol mg−1, while it is highest for pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates. The 1 kDa permeate of pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates possessed the highest antioxidant activity and it was resolved into 16 fractions by RP-HPLC. Antioxidant activity fraction 11 was highest and on custom sequencing yielded 4 peptides, of which the synthetic peptide VLPVPQK possessed the highest TEAC (5.71 ± 0.59 μmol mg−1).	10.1016/j.idairyj.2014.11.001
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antioxidant						C-terminal sequence deletion effect on antioxidative characteristics of VLPVPQK bioactive peptide from buffalo milk casein	Devi, S. et al.	In the recent time, demand for nontoxic antioxidative substances such as peptides has boomed among pharmacologists. In the present investigation, peptides, VLPVPQ and VLPVP were generated from parent antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. Initially, all these peptides were studied in-silico for biophysical properties like hydrophobicity, structure, Extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, grand average hydropathy value and Wimley White whole residue hydrophobicity. Inspite of this, homology relationship among organisms, taxonomy, digestibility assessment for proteases, solubility, melting temperature index, half-life time in-vitro and in-vivo, instability index and aliphatic index was compared in-silico. Further, based on these properties, VLPVP was compared with parent peptide, VLPVPQK for antioxidative potential. VLPVP exhibited lesser antioxidative potential by chemical method and in-vitro hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress conditions generated in fibroblast cells compared to VLPVPQK. The proliferative potential, cell injury marker, nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α was measured to compare cytoprotective antioxidative potential. The results displayed the cytoprotective potential of VLPVPQK. In addition, the present study suggested that glutamine and lysine are responsible for the c-terminal sequence based response and cytoprotective potential of milk bioactive peptide, VLPVPQK. Other than this, hydrophobic amino acids and positive charge of the VLPVPQK is also responsible for the cytoprotective potential.	10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108816
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Osteoanabolic						Repertoire of Structure-Activity-Based Novel Modified Peptides Elicits Enhanced Osteogenic Potential	Upadhyay, D. et al.	Biologically active peptides in milk proteins can be used as effective dietary supplements for management of bone-associated issues including osteoporosis. A bioactive peptide derived from milk, viz. VLPVPQK/PepC, has been validated previously from our lab for its osteoanabolic action. In this study, we report 14 novel variants of PepC, designed in silico, based on the structure–activity relationship, aiming to enhance its osteogenic effect that holds tremendous therapeutic utility for bone-related injuries. PepC was computationally modified at seven positions of its original sequence, resulting in 14 modified synthetic peptides for functional predictions and in vitro assessment by comparative analysis of modified peptides by PepC for improved ability in osteogenic functional assays (proliferation potential, antioxidant ability, gene and protein expression, cytotoxic effect, bone mineralization) using calvarial osteoblasts. For most peptides with the highest Peptide7 response relative to PepC (p < 0.05), enhanced osteoanabolic response was observed. Further observations on Peptide7 have therefore been investigated in depth (qPCR, immunoblotting, LCMS/MS, and PCA analysis). Peptide7 displayed a rise in the expression of osteogenes (Osterix, Opg, Bmp2, and Runx2, p < 0.05) and protein (Runx2 and Bmp2, p < 0.05). Besides, LCMS/MS findings suggest Peptide7 escapes intestinal peptidases degradation. Experimental evidence supports an improved osteological reaction to newly modified peptides and hence exploitation in the preparation of functional foods or supplements.	10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03385
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2
VLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Wound healing						Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.	10.1002/jcb.28246

It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019
VKEAMAPK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	113-120	Antioxidant						Caseins and Casein Hydrolysates 2 Antioxidative Properties and Relevance to Lipoxygenase Inhibition	Rival, S. et al.	The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.	10.1021/jf0003911
TQTPVVVPPFLQPE	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	93-106	Antioxidant						Antioxidant activity of yoghurt peptides: Part 1-in vitro assays and evaluation in n-3 enriched milk	Farvin, K. et al.	The aim of the present study was to investigate important factors contributing to the high oxidative stability of fish-oil-enriched yoghurt, with particular emphasis on the possible antioxidative effects of peptides released during yoghurt fermentation. Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067
QVVPYPQ	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	182-188	Antioxidant						Identification of bioactive peptides after digestion of human milk and infant formula with pepsin and pancreatin	Hernandez-Ledesma, B. et al.	Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012

The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012

HNPI	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	221-224	Antioxidant						Novel anti-oxidative peptides from enzymatic digestion of human milk	Tsopmo, A. et al.	Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146
AVPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	ACE-inhibitory		15.0				Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Derived from an Enzymatic Hydrolysate of Casein II Isolation and Bradykinin-potentiating Activity on the Uterus and the Ileum of Rats	Maruyama, S. et al.	Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein. These inhibitors potentiated bradykinin in the contraction of the uterus and the ileum of rats. The ileum was more sensitive to these inhibitors than the uterus. The bradykinin-potentiating activity of these inhibitors on the ileum lasted for more than 90 min even after washing the organ.	10.1080/00021369.1985.10866901
AVPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	ACE-inhibitory		274.0				Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides Derived from Bovine Milk Proteins	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X
AVPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli B. subtilis		Identification of novel antibacterial peptides isolated from a commercially available casein hydrolysate by autofocusing technique	Elbarbary, H. et al.	Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	10.1002/biof.1023
AVPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	Antimicrobial				Gram negative		Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019
AVPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	Antioxidant						Milk-derived bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant activity through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway	Tonolo, F. et al.	Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696
AVPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	Antioxidant						Caseins and Casein Hydrolysates 2 Antioxidative Properties and Relevance to Lipoxygenase Inhibition	Rival, S. et al.	The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.	10.1021/jf0003911

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum."	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182

RINKK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	40-44	ACE-inhibitory		18.32				ACE-inhibitory activity of probiotic yoghurt	Donkor, ON. et al.	In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009
RINKK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	40-44	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	E. coli		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085

ILPFIQSLFPFAER	P09116	Beta-casein	Oryctolagus cuniculus	64-77	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	B. subtilis E. coli		Antibacterial activity of casein-derived peptides isolated from rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) milk	Baranyi, M. et al.	Acid-precipitated rabbit ‘whole casein’ was digested by trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, and clostripain to screen for possible peptides with antibacterial properties. The peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase chromatography. The collected fractions were pooled and their antibacterial properties tested against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus. Three antibacterial peptide fragments derived from tryptic digestion of rabbit casein were isolated and identified. Their sequences were found as follows: HVEQLLR (residues 50–56 of β-casein), ILPFIQSLFPFAER (residues 64–77 of β-casein), and FHLGHLK (residues 19–25 of αs1-casein). The three peptides were synthesized and found to exert antibacterial effect against Gram positive bacteria only. Proteolytic digestion of rabbit casein by chymotrypsin, pepsin and clostripain yielded several peptide fragments with antibacterial activity. Since antibiotic peptides can be released from casein during the digestion of milk proteins, our results suggest a possible antibacterial function of rabbit caseins. It is conceivable that antibacterial peptides can be generated by endopeptidases of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract possibly providing protection for new-born rabbits against aggression of micro-organisms.	10.1017/s0022029903006150

HKEMPFPK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	121-128	Antimicrobial						Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019

DMPIQAFLLYQEPVLGPVR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	199-217	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory			Gram negative		Identification of a NFkappaB inhibitory peptide from tryptic β-casein hydrolysate	Malinowski, J. et al.	Several bioactive peptides are encrypted within the sequence of major milk proteins, requiring enzymatic proteolysis for release and activation. The present study aimed at the identification of potential anti-inflammatory activities in tryptic hydrolysates of bovine β-casein. Inflammatory processes involve in most cases an activation of Nuclear factor Kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), which is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor of several genes. Hence, a NFκB reporter cell line was established, and TNF-α mediated activation of NFκB was used as a measurement. Bovine β-casein (β-CN) was hydrolysed by trypsin and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Total proteolysate as well as the fraction containing peptides between 1 and 5 kDa showed an inhibitory effect in the cell-based assay, while the fraction containing molecules smaller than 1 kDa did not. This anti-inflammatory effect was ascribed to a group of large, hydrophobic peptides, which were identified using LC–MS. The main peptide was synthesised and showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect in HEKnfkb-RE-cells. Thus, for the first time, a casein-derived peptide having an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro has been identified.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.075
INKKI	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	41-45	Anticancer	Cytoxic for B16F10 melanoma cells					Antitumor Effect of Cationic INKKI Peptide from Bovine β-Casein on Melanoma B16F10	Azeveda, RA. et al.	Cationic peptide with the sequence INKKI 41-45 was isolated from bovine β-casein after tryptic hydrolysis and synthetized. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity in vitro and antitumor effect in animal model. The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated on B16F10 melanoma cells by MTT assay. Detection of apoptosis was measured using the annexin V/PI double staining and cell cycle analysis performed flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activity was analyzed with substrate specific fluorogenic DEVD-MCA. In vivo, antitumor activity was evaluated in B16F10 melanoma tumor-bearing C57BL/6J mice. The animals were treated with 55 mg/kg INKKI administered into peritumoral region, while control group received saline solution. The following antitumor parameters were examined: tumor volume, number of metastases, tumor delayed time, tumor doubling time. Histological analyses were performed with H & E staining. The results showed that INKKI induced dose-response cytotoxicity selective for B16F10 melanoma cells (IC50 1.7 μM) and did not present cytotoxic effects for FN1 fibroblast cells. INKKI-induced apoptosis detected trough of annexin V/PI assay and it was accompanied with an increase of sub-G1 apoptotic fractions and significant increase of caspase-3 cleavage. The tumor-bearing mice treated with INKKI showed a significant reduction in tumor volume of 72.62% and decreased of metastasis number loci. In addition, INKKI caused a significant delay in tumor growth and prolonged the tumor doubling time. Histological analysis revealed an increased of necrosis areas and reduction of tumor cells in tumor treated with INKKI, it was a many hallmark of its antitumor effects observed from in vivo experiments. In conclusion, we show that INKKI is a peptide that could be considered a new putative candidate development to anticancer therapy drug.	10.4236/jct.2012.34034
YQEPVLGPVRG	P11839	Beta-casein	Ovis aries	206-216	ACE-inhibitory		412.0				Quantitative structureeactivity relationship based screening of bioactive peptides identified in ripened cheese	Sagardia, I. et al.	The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006
YQEPVLGPVR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-217	ACE-inhibitory		300.0				Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages	Lu, Y. et al.	Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	10.3168/jds.2015-9569

Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury	10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7
YQEPVLGPVR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-217	Antithrombotic						An anticoagulant peptide from β-casein identification, structure and molecular mechanism	Liu, H. et al.	Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f

YQEPVLGPVR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-217	Immunomodulatory	Low concentrations inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, high concentrations stimulated lymphocyte proliferation					Stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by bioactive peptides derived from bovine milk proteins	Kayser, H. et al.	The in vitro modulation of the proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes of different synthetic peptides derived from milk proteins was investigated. Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.	10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4

YQEPVL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-213	ACE-inhibitory		8.14				ACE-inhibitory activity of probiotic yoghurt	Donkor, ON. et al.	In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X

In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity.

YGFLP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	74-78	ACE-inhibitory		272.39				In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

VYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	74-91	ACE-inhibitory		87.0				Fractionation and identification of ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-Lactalbumin and β-casein produced by thermolysin-catalysed hydrolysis	Otte, J. et al.	The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008

Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3

VY	Q9TVD0	Beta-casein	Camelus dromedarius	75-76	ACE-inhibitory		7.1				Release of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides during in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion of camel milk	Tagliazucchi, D. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides released from camel milk after simulated gastro-intestinal digestion were identified. The hydrolysis degree increased during digestion. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the post-pancreatic <3 kDa fraction. Peptides responsible for the biological activity were isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 17 were identical to known bioactive peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity. Based on previous structure–activity relationship studies, the sequence of some peptides allowed us to anticipate the presence of biological activities. The anti-hypertensive tripeptide isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) was identified and quantified in digested camel milk. The amount of released IPP was 2.56 ± 0.15 mg L−1 of milk. For the first time, we showed that IPP is released during the gastro-intestinal digestion of camel milk κ-casein. This research provides the basis to increase the exploitation of the health benefits of camel milk.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.01.009
VY	Q9TVD0	Beta-casein	Camelus dromedarius	75-76	ACE-inhibitory		11.0				Characterization of New Milk-derived Inhibitors of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme In Vitro and In Vivo	Fuglsang, A. et al.	inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been observed with a variety of different peptides, and peptide fragments with inhibitory capabilities have been identified within many different proteins, including milk proteins. The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.	10.1080/1475636031000138723

Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important physiological role in the regulation of hypertension. In this study, we applied virtual screening to discover a novel angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from milk casein. One potential hit was identified based on docking scores, subsequently confirmed by activity studies in vitro (IC50=20.85 μmol L−1). The proposed peptide in this study contains a unique sequence, Lys-Val-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ala. Moreover, we performed the docking studies to understand the binding mode between the enzyme and peptide hit.	10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60026-6
VRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	216-224	ACE-inhibitory						Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides Obtained from Enterococcus faecalis-Fermented Milk in Rats	Miguel, M. et al.	Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4
VRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	216-224	ACE-inhibitory		600.0				Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	Quiros, A. et al.	Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of water-soluble extracts from Manchego cheeses, which were manufactured with different starter cultures, was monitored during cheese ripening. On activity basis, the 3000 Da permeate from an 8-months-aged cheese, which was prepared with a defined-strain bacterial inoculum, was selected and fractionated by following several chromatographic steps. A total of 22 peptide fragments were identified in nine fractions by electrospray-ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry. Five of them corresponded to αs2-CN-fragments, six to β-CN fragments, and 10 of them were peptides derived from the αs1-CN sequence. The di-peptide, FP, could be originated from hydrolysis of various casein fractions. The complexity of the collected fractions after three chromatographic steps precluded the assignment of a single peptide responsible of the ACE-inhibitory activity. Fragment (199–204) from ovine β-CN, which was included in one of the most active fractions, was chemically synthesised and it was found to have an IC50 value of 592 μm.	10.1016/S0958-6946(02)00059-6

A total of 75 peptides included in the fraction with molecular mass below 3000 from an 8-month-old Manchego cheese could be identified using HPLC coupled on line to an ion trap mass spectrometer. Some previously described peptides with antihypertensive and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were detected. The formation of five active sequences was followed during cheese ripening in four different batches of Manchego cheese. Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.	10.1016/j.chroma.2004.05.022

The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056

VLGPVRGPFP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	212-221	ACE-inhibitory		137.0				Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	Quiros, A. et al.	Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011
VEP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	131-133	ACE-inhibitory		63.7				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
VENLHLPLPLL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	145-155	ACE-inhibitory		175.0				Identification of Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides Derived from Sodium Caseinate Hydrolysates Produced by Lactobacillus helveticus NCC 2765	Robert, M-C. et al.	Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t
VAPFPQPVVP	P86273	Beta-casein	Equus asinus	176-185	ACE-inhibitory		273.0				In vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion of donkeys' milk Peptide characterization by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	Bidasolo, IB. et al.	Donkeys’ milk was subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion using pepsin and a mixture of pancreatic enzymes. Analysis of the hydrolysate by high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of 46 peptides, of which 30 peptides belonged to β-casein (β-CN). The gastrointestinal digest possessed an important angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 273.0 ± 27.9 μg mL−1. The β-CN fragment f(176–185) [VAPFPQPVVP], one of the most abundant peptides in the hydrolysate, was synthesized and its ACE-inhibitory activity measured. This peptide showed very potent activity with an IC50 of 48.8 ± 2.3 μm. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a bioactive peptide from donkeys’ milk has been reported.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.04.014
TVYTKGRVMP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	107-116	ACE-inhibitory		38.0				Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme by Synthetic Peptides of Human β-Casein	Kohmura, M. et al.	The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621
TQSLVYP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	70-76	ACE-inhibitory		64.0				Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by synthetic peptide fragments of various β-caseins	Kohmura, M. et al.	Enzymatic hydrolyses of milk proteins have produced various biologically active peptides such as opioid peptides, immunostimulating peptides, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and recently, the physiological significance of such peptides has been suggested by several groups.1J If the occurrence of such peptides in milk proteins is not a casual event but has a physiological meaning, mammalian organisms should have a common mechanism to produce these peptides from the parent proteins and deliver them to each specific site. In general, physiologically important amino acid residues are conserved. If such latent peptides would be present in milk proteins, endogenous enzymes, as the first step, should recognize the amino acid residues of the peptides in the same manner throughout all species, and therefore, the sequence of such latent peptides should have a high degree of homology between all species and the same types of amino acids in the charge or hydrophobicity. Therefore, we have noted homologous sequences between various pcaseins in the stu	10.1271/bbb1961.54.1101
TPVVVPPFLQP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	95-105	ACE-inhibitory		749.0				Structural analysis of new antihypertensive peptides derived from cheese whey protein by proteinase K digestion	Abubakar, A. et al.	Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3
TGPIPN	P33048	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	78-83	ACE-inhibitory		316.0				Identification and Characterization of Novel Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Obtained from Goat Milk	Geerlings, A. et al.	The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize new inhibitory peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) from goat milk and to analyze the effect of long-term intake of a goat milk hydrolysate-supplemented (GP-hyd) diet on the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Three new inhibitory peptides for ACE (TGPIPN, SLPQ, and SQPK) were isolated. The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values of individual peptides were 316, 330, and 354 μmol/L, respectively. Only TGPIPN was found to pass intact a monolayer of Caco-2 cells in small amounts. The SHR fed for 12 wk a diet (GP-hyd) enriched in a hydrolysate containing these peptides (estimated intake of TGPIPN was 230 mg/kg per d) showed lower (approximately 15 mmHg) systolic blood pressure than animals fed a control diet. The ACE activities in the aorta, left ventricle, and kidney were significantly decreased in the GP-hyd group compared with those of the control group and were similar to those found in SHR fed captopril (130 mg/kg per d). Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine by aortic rings from SHR was improved in those fed the GP-hyd diet. The left ventricle weight and kidney weight index were significantly reduced in the GP-hyd group and captopril groups. Moreover, long-term treatment of SHR with a diet enriched in goat milk hydrolysate, or captopril, attenuated the development of hypertension, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and endothelial dysfunction. These effects might be related to the in vivo inhibitory effects of the hydrolysate on tissue ACE activity.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72369-4
TF	Q9TVD0	Beta-casein	Camelus dromedarius	67-68	ACE-inhibitory		18.0				Release of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides during in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion of camel milk	Tagliazucchi, D. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides released from camel milk after simulated gastro-intestinal digestion were identified. The hydrolysis degree increased during digestion. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the post-pancreatic <3 kDa fraction. Peptides responsible for the biological activity were isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 17 were identical to known bioactive peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity. Based on previous structure–activity relationship studies, the sequence of some peptides allowed us to anticipate the presence of biological activities. The anti-hypertensive tripeptide isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) was identified and quantified in digested camel milk. The amount of released IPP was 2.56 ± 0.15 mg L−1 of milk. For the first time, we showed that IPP is released during the gastro-intestinal digestion of camel milk κ-casein. This research provides the basis to increase the exploitation of the health benefits of camel milk.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.01.009
SQSKVLPVPQ	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	181-190	ACE-inhibitory		92.0				Casein Fermentate of Lactobacillus animalisDPC6134 Contains a Range of Novel Propeptide Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors	Hayes, M. et al.	This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07

SLPQN	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	84-88	ACE-inhibitory		9.49				ACE-inhibitory activity of probiotic yoghurt	Donkor, ON. et al.	In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0

Enzymatic hydrolyses of milk proteins have produced various biologically active peptides such as opioid peptides, immunostimulating peptides, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and recently, the physiological significance of such peptides has been suggested by several groups.1J If the occurrence of such peptides in milk proteins is not a casual event but has a physiological meaning, mammalian organisms should have a common mechanism to produce these peptides from the parent proteins and deliver them to each specific site. In general, physiologically important amino acid residues are conserved. If such latent peptides would be present in milk proteins, endogenous enzymes, as the first step, should recognize the amino acid residues of the peptides in the same manner throughout all species, and therefore, the sequence of such latent peptides should have a high degree of homology between all species and the same types of amino acids in the charge or hydrophobicity.

QEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	209-224	ACE-inhibitory		600.0				Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages	Lu, Y. et al.	Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	10.3168/jds.2015-9569

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0

Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012

The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml.

Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000
NILP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	80-83	ACE-inhibitory		560.0				Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme by Synthetic Peptides of Human β-Casein	Kohmura, M. et al.	The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM.

MAP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	117-119	ACE-inhibitory		0.4				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
MAP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	117-119	ACE-inhibitory		0.8				Antihypertensive effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory peptide from enzyme modified cheese	Tonouchi, H. et al.	Two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were isolated from enzyme modified cheese (EMC) and their amino acid sequences were identified as Leu-Gln-Pro and Met-Ala-Pro. The EMC was prepared by a combination of Protease N, Umamizyme, and Flavourzyme 500L. Both peptides were derived from β-casein, f 88-90 and f 102-104, respectively. Met-Ala-Pro showed strong ACE inhibitory activity (IC50=0·8 μm) and antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after single oral administration. The IC50 value of Met-Ala-Pro was not affected by pre-incubation with ACE, suggesting that this peptide was a true ACE-inhibitory peptide. We report here, for the first time antihypertensive peptides from EMC.	10.1017/S0022029908003452

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0
LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	73-91	ACE-inhibitory		5.2				Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	Quiros, A. et al.	Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003

The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008

Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003

Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5

LVYPFP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	73-78	ACE-inhibitory		132.0				Novel probiotic-fermented milk with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides produced by Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5	Gonzalez-Gonzalez, C. et al.	In previous research, we have demonstrated that Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5 fermented milk possessed stronger angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity than other lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus helveticus DSM 13137, which produces the hypotensive casokinins Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Val-Pro-Pro (VPP). The aim of this study is to investigate the ACE-inhibitory peptides released in B. bifidum MF 20/5 fermented milk. The novel ACE-inhibitory peptide LVYPFP (IC50 = 132 μM) is reported here for the first time. Additionally, other bioactive peptides such as the ACE-inhibitor LPLP (IC50 = 703 μM), and the antioxidant VLPVPQK were identified. Moreover, the peptide and amino acid profiles, the ACE-inhibitory activity (ACEi), pH, and degree of hydrolysis of the fermented milk were determined and compared with those obtained in milk fermented by L. helveticus DSM 13137. The sequences of the major bioactive peptides present in fermented milk of B. bifidum and L. helveticus were identified and quantified. B. bifidum released a larger amount of peptides than L. helveticus but no IPP or VPP were detected in B. bifidum fermented milk. Also the lactotripeptide concentrations and ACEi were higher in L. helveticus fermented milk when the pH was maintained at 4.6. This may represent a technical advantage for B. bifidum that reduces the pH at a slow enough rate to facilitate the peptide generation without the need for pH control. Thus these findings show the potential for the use of this probiotic strain to produce fermented milk with a wider range of health benefits including reduction of blood pressure.	10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.09.002

Enzymatic hydrolyses of milk proteins have produced various biologically active peptides such as opioid peptides, immunostimulating peptides, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and recently, the physiological significance of such peptides has been suggested by several groups.1J If the occurrence of such peptides in milk proteins is not a casual event but has a physiological meaning, mammalian organisms should have a common mechanism to produce these peptides from the parent proteins and deliver them to each specific site. In general, physiologically important amino acid residues are conserved. If such latent peptides would be present in milk proteins, endogenous enzymes, as the first step, should recognize the amino acid residues of the peptides in the same manner throughout all species, and therefore, the sequence of such latent peptides should have a high degree of homology between all species and the same types of amino acids in the charge or hydrophobicity. Therefore, we have noted homologous sequences between various pcaseins in the stu	10.1271/bbb1961.54.1101
LQSW	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	155-158	ACE-inhibitory		500.0				Identification of an Antihypertensive Peptide from Casein Hydrolysate Produced by a Proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790	Maeno, M. et al.	Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1
LQP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	103-105	ACE-inhibitory		3.4				Antihypertensive effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory peptide from enzyme modified cheese	Tonouchi, H. et al.	Two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were isolated from enzyme modified cheese (EMC) and their amino acid sequences were identified as Leu-Gln-Pro and Met-Ala-Pro. The EMC was prepared by a combination of Protease N, Umamizyme, and Flavourzyme 500L. Both peptides were derived from β-casein, f 88-90 and f 102-104, respectively. Met-Ala-Pro showed strong ACE inhibitory activity (IC50=0·8 μm) and antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after single oral administration. The IC50 value of Met-Ala-Pro was not affected by pre-incubation with ACE, suggesting that this peptide was a true ACE-inhibitory peptide. We report here, for the first time antihypertensive peptides from EMC.	10.1017/S0022029908003452

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621

The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
LPLP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	141-144	ACE-inhibitory		750.0				Novel probiotic-fermented milk with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides produced by Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5	Gonzalez-Gonzalez, C. et al.	In previous research, we have demonstrated that Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5 fermented milk possessed stronger angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity than other lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus helveticus DSM 13137, which produces the hypotensive casokinins Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Val-Pro-Pro (VPP). The aim of this study is to investigate the ACE-inhibitory peptides released in B. bifidum MF 20/5 fermented milk. The novel ACE-inhibitory peptide LVYPFP (IC50 = 132 μM) is reported here for the first time. Additionally, other bioactive peptides such as the ACE-inhibitor LPLP (IC50 = 703 μM), and the antioxidant VLPVPQK were identified. Moreover, the peptide and amino acid profiles, the ACE-inhibitory activity (ACEi), pH, and degree of hydrolysis of the fermented milk were determined and compared with those obtained in milk fermented by L. helveticus DSM 13137. The sequences of the major bioactive peptides present in fermented milk of B. bifidum and L. helveticus were identified and quantified. B. bifidum released a larger amount of peptides than L. helveticus but no IPP or VPP were detected in B. bifidum fermented milk. Also the lactotripeptide concentrations and ACEi were higher in L. helveticus fermented milk when the pH was maintained at 4.6. This may represent a technical advantage for B. bifidum that reduces the pH at a slow enough rate to facilitate the peptide generation without the need for pH control. Thus these findings show the potential for the use of this probiotic strain to produce fermented milk with a wider range of health benefits including reduction of blood pressure.	10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.09.002

LNVPGEIVE	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	21-29	ACE-inhibitory		300.1				Production of Angiotensin-I-Converting-Enzyme-Inhibitory Peptides in Fermented Milks Started by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus SS1 and Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris FT4	Gobbetti, M. et al.	Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000

LHLPLPL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	148-154	ACE-inhibitory		425.0				Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	Quiros, A. et al.	Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011
LHLPLP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	139-144	ACE-inhibitory		3.7				Stability to gastrointestinal enzymes and structure-activity relationship of β-casein-peptides with antihypertensive properties	Quiros, A. et al.	Physiological digestion plays a key role in the formation and degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on the stability of eight peptides previously identified in fermented milk with antihypertensive activity. Two of these identified peptides with sequences LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, possess ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro and antihypertensive activity in vivo. The results showed that LHLPLP was resistant to digestive enzymes. In contrast, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP was totally hydrolyzed and its activity decreased after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. The peptide LHLPLP was incubated with ACE and was found to be a true inhibitor of the enzyme and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor pattern. A structure-activity relationship study of this peptide was carried out by synthesizing several modified peptides related to the sequence LHLPLP. The substitution of amino acid Leu in the penultimate position by Gly improved the ACE-inhibitory activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at C-terminal position by Arg increased the activity twofold, with an IC50 of LHLPLR as low as 1.8 microM.	10.1016/j.peptides.2009.06.031
LHLPLP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	139-144	ACE-inhibitory		5.4				Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides Obtained from Enterococcus faecalis-Fermented Milk in Rats	Miguel, M. et al.	Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4

Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098

Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1
KVLPVPQ	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	184-190	ACE-inhibitory						Characterization of casein-derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976

KVLPVP	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	184-189	ACE-inhibitory						High-Level Expression of Milk-Derived Antihypertensive Peptide in Escherichia coli and Its Bioactivity	Liu, D. et al.	An optimal antihypertensive peptide (AHP), KVLPVP, was linked to form a six-copy of tandem dotetracontapeptide with the specific cleavage site (Arg-X) of clostripain. The gene of the dotetracontapeptide was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. After a 5 h induction with 1.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the recombinant AHP fused with glutathione-S-transferase tag reached the maximal production, 24.6% of total intracellular protein. Following digestion with clostripain and carboxypeptidase B, the product was separated with ultrafiltration and reversed-phase HPLC, and 170 mg of pure recombinant AHP was obtained from 1 L of E. coli culture. The IC50 of the recombinant AHP was 4.6 microM. The systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats could be decreased dramatically by the recombinant AHP in a dose-dependent manner after delivering 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of body weight (BW) or 0.6 mg of AHP/kg of BW orally. The strong antihypertensive effect was reached 4-24 h after oral administration of 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of BW, and the peak point was at the fourth hour (-21.4 +/- 7.2 mm of Hg). This study overcame traditional enzymatic digestion problems in preparing AHP and established a novel approach for industrial production of AHP.	10.1021/jf0703248

The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates.

In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals. SBP and DBP returned to baseline values 24 h post-administration of all peptides.

Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity.

The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively.

Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000

Some previously described peptides with antihypertensive and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were detected. The formation of five active sequences was followed during cheese ripening in four different batches of Manchego cheese. Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.	10.1016/j.chroma.2004.05.022

Some of the most potent ACE-inhibitory peptides described in food have a proline at the end of their sequence, a characteristic that can cause problems in the synthesis procedures. In this work, we studied two different preparations of peptide Asp-Lys-Ile-His-Pro (DKIHP), which were obtained by two different synthetic procedures (Boc and Fmoc). The peptide synthesized by the Boc method yielded a unique conformer, containing trans-Pro, and significant ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50 = 113.18 μM). The chromatographic and NMR data of this active conformer are reported. The peptide synthesized by Fmoc chemistry yielded three conformers, two of them containing trans-Pro and a third one containing cis-Pro, and showed a lower activity (IC50 = 577.92 μM). This was attributed to the presence of conformers with less (or none) activity. We have pointed out the importance of performing structural studies on these type of peptides before testing their ACE-inhibitory activity.	10.1021/jf049532f

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0

"The fragment-peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI12, CEI5 and CEIβ7) derived from an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein were synthesized. Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I."	10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244

LLNQELLLNPTHQIYPV	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	197-213	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus Y. enterocolitica		Investigation into the antimicrobial action and mechanism of a novel endogenous peptide ?-casein 197 from human milk	Fu, Yanrong. et al.	A novel endogenous peptide cleaved from 197–213 AA of β-casein, named β-casein 197, was identified by tandem mass spectrometry. β-casein 197 constituted a significant proportion of the peptide content in preterm milk. This study investigated the antibacterial effects and mechanisms against common pathogenic bacteria. Six bacterial strains were selected for this study: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia and Bacillus subtilis. After synthesis, serial twofold dilutions of β-casein 197 were added to select for sensitive bacteria. The disk diffusion method and analysis of bacterial staining were used to identify antibacterial effect, while DNA-binding, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to explore antimicrobial mechanisms. Disk diffusion showed that E. coli, S. aureus and Y. enterocolitica were sensitive to the β-casein 197. In addition, live/dead fluorescent staining also confirmed antibacterial effects. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy revealed affected extracellular and intracellular structure for three species of bacteria, while a DNA-binding assay showed that the antimicrobial activity did not occur through DNA binding. This study suggests that β-casein 197 has antimicrobial activity against common pathogenic bacteria in newborns with infection. The peptide induced membrane permeabilization but did not bind to genomic DNA. Based on our findings, β-casein 197 has potential clinical value for preventing infections of premature infants.	10.1186/s13568-017-0409-y

A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2

Inflammation and oxidative stress are closely linked patho-physiological processes which occur concurrently in many diseased conditions. Recently, interdependence between these two processes explains the antioxidant paradox associated with failure to select appropriate agents required for prevention of diseases known to be induced by oxidative stress. Present study established the overlapping anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative potential along with bio-accessibility of milk casein derived tripeptide (LLY). Tripeptide exhibited anti-inflammatory response under ex vivo conditions by suppressing (P<.01) mice splenocytes proliferation and modulating their cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β) with improved phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages. Conversely, tripeptide displayed extraordinary radical scavenging ability and cellular anti-oxidative potential using chemical assays and H2O2 induced oxidative stress model on Caco-2 cells. Under cellular assessment, on one hand tripeptide inhibited (P<.01) intracellular ROS generation and reduced MDA and protein carbonyls but on the other also increased (P<.01) the activity of anti-oxidative enzyme, catalase without much effect on SOD and GPx. This anti-oxidative potential was further established by studying relative expression of genes (Nrf-2 and Keap1) and Nrf-2 nuclear translocation associated with anti-oxidative signaling in Caco-2 cells. Bio-accessibility of tripeptide and its intact transport across Caco-2 cell monolayer was also found to be 1.72±0.22% through PepT1 mediated transport mechanism. Besides, tripeptide displayed strong anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential under in vivo conditions in mice against ethanol induced oxidative stress by elevating (P<.01) liver GSH content and by decreasing (P<.01) the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes, MDA along with reduced expression of CYP2E1, PPAR-α, TNF-α and COX-2 genes than ethanol control.	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.09.002

YPVTQPLAPVHNPIS	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	211-225	Antimicrobial						A novel endogenous antimicrobial peptide CAMP211-225 derived from casein in human milk	 Cui, X. et al.	A large number of bioactive peptides derived from breast milk have been identified to be multifunctional having anti-inflammatory, immunoregulation and antimicrobial activity. Here, we report that an endogenous peptide from β-casein 211-225 amino acid from human breast milk (hereafter called CAMP211-225) presents specific antimicrobial activity against pathogenic E. coli and Y. enterocolitica. CAMP211-225 is a novel peptide that occurs at higher levels in preterm milk than in term milk. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of CAMP211-225 against E. coli and Y. enterocolitica are 3.125 μg/ml and 6.25 μg/ml, respectively, and the antimicrobial activity of CAMP211-225 was also confirmed by disk diffusion assay. Further studies by fluorescence staining, scanning electron microscopy and a DNA-binding assay revealed that CAMP211-225 kills bacteria through a membrane-disrupting mechanism, but not by binding to intracellular nucleic acids. Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease in neonatal intensive care units. In our study, CAMP211-225 administration effectively reduced ileal mucosa damage in an experimental NEC mice model. These results suggest that the antimicrobial peptide CAMP211-225 may have potential value to prevent and treat neonatal infections.	10.1039/c9fo02813g

This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586

VPYPQR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	193-198	Antioxidant						 Insight into antioxidant properties of milk derived bioactive peptides in vitro and in a cellular model	Tonolo, F. et al.	Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress. The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, the reported hydrolyzed peptides are shown to exert the antioxidant properties both in vitro and in a cellular model.	10.1002/psc.3162

To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117
NVPGEIVESL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	22-31	Antioxidant						Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	Tonolo, F. et al.	Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested.

RELEEL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	16-21	Antioxidant						Isolation of antioxidant peptides from yak casein	Liu, Q. et al.	Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein is a principal method to obtain antioxidant peptides. A yak casein hydrolysate (YCH) was prepared by alcalase and trypsin digestion. An ultrafiltration membrane system was used to divide the hydrolysate into four molecular weight fractions; YCH-4 (<3 kDa) had the highest antioxidant activity. Fraction YCH-4 was separated into six subfractions by gel filtration chromatography; reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was then used to partition sixteen antioxidant peptide subfractions. Liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to determine the amino acid sequence of a purified antioxidant peptide to be Arg-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu (787.41 Da). Finally, a synthetic Arg-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu peptide was evaluated for its superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.52 and 0.69 mg mL−1), which confirmed the activity of the native purified peptide. Our results suggested that isolation and purification of antioxidant peptides from yak casein could be an important means to obtain natural antioxidant peptides.	10.1039/D0RA02644A

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976

Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008

Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.	10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042

Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711

GRVMPVLKSPTIPFFDPQIP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	112-131	Immunomodulatory	stimulated the chemokine production and monocyte recruitment in vivo					A Novel Anti-Infective Peptide BCCY-1 With Immunomodulatory Activities	Cai, J. et al.	Antibiotic resistance has been considered to be a global threat which underscores the need to develop novel anti-infective therapeutics. Modulation of innate immunity by synthetic peptides is an attractive strategy to overcome this circumstance. We recently reported that BCCY-1, a human β-casein-derived peptide displays regulatory activities on monocytes, thereby enhancing their actions in innate immune responses. However, the function of peptide BCCY-1 in host defense against infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the in vivo characteristics and effects of peptide BCCY-1 in mouse models of bacterial infection. Following intraperitoneal injection, the peptide BCCY-1 exhibited high level of cellular uptake by monocytes without obvious toxicities. Results revealed that peptide BCCY-1, but not the scrambled version, stimulated the chemokine production and monocyte recruitment in vivo. Treatment with BCCY-1 enhanced the pathogen clearance and protected mice against lethal infections. Because the anti-infective effects of BCCY-1 was abolished by in vivo depletion of monocytes/macrophages rather than lymphocytes and granulocytes, we conclude that monocytes/macrophages are key effector cells in BCCY-1-mediated anti-infective protection. Additionally, BCCY-1 lacks direct antimicrobial activity. To our knowledge, a human β-casein-derived peptide that counters infection by selective regulation of innate immunity has not been reported previously. These results suggest peptide BCCY-1 as a promising alternative approach and a valuable complement to current anti-infective strategy.	10.3389/fimmu.2021.713960
GRVMPVLKSPTIPFFDPQIP	P05814	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	112-131	Immunomodulatory	BCCY-1 enhanced chemokine production and monocyte migration					A human β-casein-derived peptide BCCY-1 modulates the innate immune response	Cai, J. et al.	In this study, we report a novel peptide corresponding to the sequence of human β-casein (named BCCY-1), which was identified in our previous peptidome analysis of human milk and has great immunomodulatory activity. The results revealed that peptide BCCY-1, but not the scrambled version, enhanced monocyte migration without obvious toxicities. This selective effect was mediated via increased production of chemokines by peptide stimulated monocytes. Moreover, BCCY-1 exerted its modulatory effects by activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The abundances of peptide BCCY-1 and the peptides partially encompassing its fragment were found to be lower in preterm milk than in term milk. Our study may lead to new insights into the immunoregulatory effects of casein-derived peptides and facilitate the discovery of novel peptide-based food and pharmaceutical products.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.129111
DVENLHLPLPL	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	144-154	Antimicrobial						Modulation of Virulence Gene Expression in Salmonella enterica subsp enterica typhimurium by Synthetic Milk-Derived Peptides	Ali, E. et al.	The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides.

YPFPGPIPNS	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-84	Antianxiety						Release of an anti-anxiety peptide in casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease	Takeuchi, Y. et al.	Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h
RELEELNVPGEIVESLSSSEESITR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	16-40	Immunomodulatory	Induced proliferation of mouse splenocytes.					Identification  of  a  phosphopeptide  in  bovine  α  s1-casein  digest  as  a  factor  influencing  proliferation  and  immunoglobulin  production  in  lymphocyte  cultures.  	Hata,  I. et al.	Digestion of bovine αs1-casein with bovine trypsin produced peptide(s) with an inhibitory effect on concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells. One of these peptides was isolated from the αs1-casein digest following ultrafiltration, hydroxyapatite chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, and amino acid composition and sequence analyses showed it to be sequence 59–79 from the phosphoserine-rich region of αs1-casein. The isolated peptide significantly inhibited the concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells, whereas it enhanced the lipopolysaccharide- and phytohaemagglutinin-induced proliferation of both cells. The peptide displayed mitogenic activity in the cell cultures without the commercial mitogen, and significantly enhanced immunoglobulin production. Moreover, residues 1–25 from the phosphoserine-rich region of bovine β-casein had a similar effect on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells stimulated or not stimulated by the commercial mitogen. These results indicate that caseinophosphopeptides may act as a humoral immunostimulator in cell cultures.	10.1017/s0022029998003136
RELEELNVPGEIVESLSSSEESITR	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	16-40	Increase calcium uptake					4  Phosphorylations	Bioactive  peptide  isolated  from  casein  phosphopeptides  promotes  calcium  uptake  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  	Guo  L. et al.	Casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) have been demonstrated to be calcium chelators. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported on the effects of CPPs on the mechanism of the uptake and absorption of Ca2+ and bone metabolism. In this study, a monomeric peptide fraction isolated by RP-HPLC (F6-1) that possessed high calcium transport capacity in Caco-2 cell monolayers was separated and characterized. The effects of F6-1 on the absorption mechanisms of Ca2+ in a Caco-2 monolayer model and bone metabolism in rats were investigated. F6-1 was isolated by preparative and analytical RP-HPLC. Results for calcium transport suggested that the rates of Ca2+ transportation by F6-1 were approximately 2.57, 2.87 and 2.38 times higher than those in the control group at 30, 60 and 120 min, respectively. Results of ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy indicated that the intensity of UV absorption changed because of the binding of Ca2+ to F6-1. Analysis of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the expression of TRPV6 in Caco-2 cells showed that F6-1 was likely to influence the transcellular pathway of intestinal absorption of Ca2+ rather than the paracellular pathway. Furthermore, the F6-1 group (1% Ca, 0.03% F6-1) exhibited Increase in serum Ca2+ levels, femur length and femur Ca and decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and urinary pyridinoline content in a Sprague-Dawley rat model, which implied that F6-1 was beneficial for bone calcification. Overall, our results suggested that F6-1 enhanced the transport of Ca2+ in Caco-2 cells by affecting the transcellular pathway by upregulating the expression of TRPV6. F6-1 also improved bone formation and prevented bone resorption to benefit bone health in rats, which provided a basis for using F6-1 in calcium supplements or functional foods.	10.1039/C7FO01709J

KVLPVPQK	P02666	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	184-191	Antioxidant						Milk-derived  bioactive  peptides  exhibit antioxidant  activity  through  the  Keap1-Nrf2  signaling  pathway	Tonolo, F. et al.	Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696

Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.	10.1039/c7fo01646h

The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.	10.1021/jf0003911

Tonolo, F. et al.	Redox status and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of the majority of diseases. Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.	10.3390/ijms23084382
TPVVVPPFL	A0A344X7B9	Beta-casein	Bos mutus	130-138	Anticancer						Preparation and identification of anti-breast cancer cells peptides released from yak milk casein	Gu, H. et al.	Yak milk casein (YMC) is the main protein in the yak milk. Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.	10.3389/fnut.2022.997514

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003

Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033

Rendon-Rosales, M. et al.	The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.	10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581

This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033

Nongonierma, A. et al.	Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides.

Yak (Bos grunniens) milk casein derived from Qula, a kind of acid curd cheese from northwestern China, was hydrolysed with alcalase. The hydrolysates collected at different hydrolysis times (0 min, 60 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 300 min, 360 min) were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE), and the one obtained at 240 min hydrolysis showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity. The active hydrolysate was further consecutively separated by ultrafiltration with 10 kDa and then with 6 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes into different parts, and the 6 kDa permeate showed the highest ACE-inhibiting activity. This active fraction was further purified to yield two novel ACE-inhibiting peptides, whose amino acid sequences were Pro–Pro–Glu–Ile–Asn (PPEIN)(κ-CN; f156–160) and Pro–Leu–Pro–Leu–Leu (PLPLL) (β-CN; f136–140), respectively. The molecular weight and IC50 value of the peptides were 550 Da and 566.4 Da, and 0.29 ± 0.01 mg/ml and 0.25 ± 0.01 mg/ml, respectively.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.10.041
VLVLDTDYKKYLLF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	108-121	Increase cellular growth	stimulates muring splenocyte proliferation					Proliferative effects of synthetic peptides from β-lactoglobulin and α-Lactalbumin on murine splenocytes	Jacquot, A. et al.	Eleven peptides, selected on the basis of physicochemical characteristics and their theoretical release from β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-La) by trypsin or chymotrypsin, were chemically synthesised to evaluate their immunomodulating properties. Murine splenocyte proliferation in the absence and presence of mitogen and different peptide concentrations were measured after 72–96 h incubations. β-Lg f78–83 had no effect on proliferation; β-Lg f15–20, f55–60, f84–91, f92–105, f139–148, f142–148 and α-La f10–16 stimulated proliferation to different extents; β-Lg f1–8, f102–105 and α-La f104–108 showed a cytotoxic effect. Regression analysis revealed the relationship of positive charge, hydrophobicity and length to the stimulatory proliferative effect. β-Lg f15–20, f55–60 and f139–148 also induced various inhibiting and/or stimulating effects on cytokine secretion. The results confirm that peptides releasable by digestive enzymes from α-La and β-Lg have the potential to influence the specific immune response through the modulation of splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.02.013
VAGTWY	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	31-36	ACE-inhibitory		767.5				Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of whey protein digests: concentration and characterization of active peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	The aim of this study was to identify whey-derived peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The bovine whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination. The total hydrolysates were fractionated in a two step ultrafiltration process, first with a 30 kDa membrane and then with a 1 kDa membrane. Inhibition of ACE was analysed spectrophotometrically. The peptides were isolated by chromatography and identified by mass and sequencing analysis. The most potent inhibitory peptides were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50 % inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345–1733 μg/ml. The IC50 values for the 1–30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 μg/ml and for the <1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77–1062 μM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were α-lactalbumin fractions (50–52), (99–108) and (104–108) and β-lactoglobulin fractions (22–25), (32–40), (81–83), (94–100), (106–111) and (142–146).	10.1017/s0022029999003982
VAGTWY	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	31-36	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	B. subtilis		Isolation and characterization of four bactericidal domains in the bovine β-lactoglobulin	Pellegrini, A. et al.	Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.	10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7

Whey proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides which may play a role in the dietary management of chronic diseases. Fractionation via ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the enrichment of antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg TH). UF processing selectively enhanced the biofunctional properties of β-Lg TH with the permeate obtained using a 1 kDa polyethersulfone (HFP-1) membrane having highest in vitro multifunctional bioactivity.

The multifunctional peptide VAGTWY, β-Lg f(15–20) was shown to have potent antioxidant activity (5.63 µmol TE/µmol peptide). Two new ACE inhibitory peptides, IIAEK and IPAVFK, having IC50 values of 63.7 ± 7.22 and 144.8 ± 25.3 μM, respectively, were also identified in β-Lg TH.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease involved in the degradation and inactivation of incretin hormones that act by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion after meal ingestion. DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity. These fractions were analysed by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify peptides responsible for the observed activity. The most potent fragment (IPAVF) corresponded to β-lactoglobulin f(78–82) which IC50 value was 44.7 μM.

Ultrafiltration permeate of whey protein tryptic hydrolyzate was processed by nanofiltration (NF) to obtain retentate (NFR) and permeate (NFP) that were then tested as inhibitors of Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. NFR at 20 mg mL−1 was most effective as an inhibitor (P < 0.001); whereas E. coli was relatively resistant, the effect on Listeria and S. aureus was greater at 20 mg mL−1 than at 10 mg mL−1 (P < 0.01). Peptide analysis revealed that NFR was rich in anionic peptides over eight amino acid residues in length. The antibacterial activity of two anionic peptides (84–91 and 125–135) and a cationic peptide (36–42) derived from β-lactoglobulin was tested. Peptide 125–135 was more inhibitory (P < 0.05) than peptide 84–91 against Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus; peptide 36–42 was not inhibitory. NFR appears to have potential as a natural bio-preservative.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.09.003

This solid-phase extraction fraction was shown by mass spectroscopy to contain β-lg f(142–148). This peptide had an ACE IC50 value of 42.6 μmol/l. The peptide was resistant to further digestion with pepsin and was hydrolysed to a very low extent with chymotrypsin. The contribution of specific amino acid residues within the peptide to ACE inhibitory activity and the potential application of this peptide as a nutraceutical is discussed.	10.1016/s0014-5793(96)01503-7
ALPMHIR	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	158-164	ACE-inhibitory		14.0				Antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro	Yamada, A. et al.	The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098
ALPMHIR	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	158-164	Antihypertensive	Reduced vasoconstrictorendothelin-1 release					Influence of the lactokinin Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALPMHIR) on the release of endothelin-1 by endothelial cells	Maes, W. et al.	Milk protein-derived peptides with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity can reduce blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. The lactokinin Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALPMHIR) is an ACE-inhibitory peptide released by tryptic digestion from the milk protein β-lactoglobulin. Its ACE-inhibitory activity is 100 times lower than that of captopril. The latter is known to inhibit the release of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) by endothelial cells. The effects of ALPMHIR on the endothelium are currently unknown. In this study, the influence of ALPMHIR on release of ET-1 by endothelial cells was investigated. The basal ET-1 release of the cells was reduced by 29% (p<0.01) in the presence of 1 mM ALPMHIR, compared to 42% (p<0.01) for 0.1 mM captopril. Addition of 10 U/ml thrombin to the incubation medium increased the release of ET-1 by 66% (p<0.01). Co-incubation of 10 U/ml thrombin with 1 μM captopril or with 0.1 mM ALPMHIR inhibited the stimulated ET-1 release by 45% (p<0.01) and by 32% (p<0.01), respectively. These data indicate that dietary peptides, such as ALPMHIR, can modulate ET-1 release by endothelial cells. These effects, among other mechanisms, may play a role in the anti-hypertensive effect of milk protein-derived peptides.	10.1016/j.regpep.2003.11.005

Eleven peptides, selected on the basis of physicochemical characteristics and their theoretical release from β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-La) by trypsin or chymotrypsin, were chemically synthesised to evaluate their immunomodulating properties. Murine splenocyte proliferation in the absence and presence of mitogen and different peptide concentrations were measured after 72–96 h incubations. β-Lg f78–83 had no effect on proliferation; β-Lg f15–20, f55–60, f84–91, f92–105, f139–148, f142–148 and α-La f10–16 stimulated proliferation to different extents; β-Lg f1–8, f102–105 and α-La f104–108 showed a cytotoxic effect. Regression analysis revealed the relationship of positive charge, hydrophobicity and length to the stimulatory proliferative effect. β-Lg f15–20, f55–60 and f139–148 also induced various inhibiting and/or stimulating effects on cytokine secretion. The results confirm that peptides releasable by digestive enzymes from α-La and β-Lg have the potential to influence the specific immune response through the modulation of splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.02.013

YLLF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	118-121	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

YLLF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	118-121	Increase mucin secretion						Effect of β-lactoglobulin hydrolysate and β-lactorphin on intestinal mucin secretion and gene expression in human goblet cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	A hydrolysate obtained from a whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin has been shown to stimulate mucin secretion and mucin 5AC gene expression in human intestinal goblet cells HT29-MTX. Mass spectrometry-based peptidomic analysis allowed the identification of the peptides contained in the hydrolysate. None of them had the required structure to bind opioid receptors, except for the sequence YLLF, corresponding to β-lactorphin. The exposure of the cells to synthetic β-lactorphin evoked a mucin secretory effect although no change in the mucin gene expression was observed. The amidated homolog of this peptide, which has been reported as a more potent opioid, induced mucin gene expression after incubation for 4 h. This supports the hypothesis that induction of the mucin secretory response can be mediated by μ-opioid receptors in HT29-MTX cells, although other mechanisms responsible for the hydrolysate activity cannot be excluded. Protein hydrolysates with the ability to induce mucin secretion could be promising for improving gastrointestinal protection.	10.1016/j.foodres.2012.12.029
YLLF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	118-121	Increase mucin secretion						Food-Derived Peptides Stimulate Mucin Secretion and Gene Expression in Intestinal Cells	Martinez-Maqueda, D. et al.	In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.	10.1021/jf301279k

YLLF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	118-121	Opioid						Bioactive peptides derived from bovine whey proteins: opioid and ace-inhibitory peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	Regulatory peptides can be released by enzymatic proteolysis of food proteins and may act as potential physiological modulators of metabolism during the intestinal digestion of the diet. The possible regulatory effects of peptides relate to nutrient uptake, immune defence, opioid and antihypertensive activities. Milk proteins, especially caseins, are an important source of these bioactive peptides. During recent years, major whey protein components, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin, were also shown to contain bioactive sequences. Peptides showing opioid and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity were found in α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. Opioid peptides, α-lactorphin and β-lactorphin, were liberated during in vitro proteolysis of bovine whey proteins, and pharmacological activity was observed at micromolar concentrations. Whey hydrolysates showed ACE-inhibitory activity after proteolysis with different digestive enzymes, and several active peptides were identified. The results demonstrated the existence of several biologically active whey-derived peptides and hydrolysates. The findings of the study can be exploited in the development of foods with special health claims (e.g. treatment of hypertension) as well as in identifying new applications in food.	10.1016/S0924-2244(01)00003-6
YLLF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	118-121	Osteoanabolic						Osteoanabolic activity of whey-derived anti-oxidative (MHIRL and YVEEL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (YLLF, ALPMHIR, IPA and WLAHK) bioactive peptides	Pandey, M. et al.	Exploring bone rebuilding anabolic agents has been gaining much attention due to their potential therapeutic effects in treating several bone disorders including osteoporosis. Whey protein has been reported to affect bone health osteoanabolically, in terms of proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells. This study investigates whether whey derived anti-oxidative (AO) (P1- MHIRL, P2- YVEEL) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) (P3- YLLF, P4-ALPMHIR, P5-IPA, P6- WLAHK) bioactive peptides affect the proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells isolated from rat calvaria. The proliferation and osteogenic activity of osteoblast cells in presence of these peptides were determined by MTT assay, DNA quantification study, Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and ALP staining, Alizarin red activity and staining, and secretory osteocalcin measurement. The expression of osteogenesis-related genes (COLI-α, ALP, OCN and RUNX2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis over a period of 21 days. The peptide treated osteoblasts showed a significant increase in viable cell density and proliferation in the order of P2 > P6 > P3 at optimised concentration. Furthermore, the osteoblastic differentiation markers in response to these peptides were found to be significantly up regulated in the order of P2 > P6 > P3 when compared to the controls. These results demonstrated that bioactive whey-derived AO and ACE inhibitory peptides can play a potential therapeutic role in osteoporosis by activating osteoblasts anabolically.	10.1016/j.peptides.2017.11.004

Milk contains various bioactive components with osteoanabolic properties. This study investigates the comparative effect of the whey-derived antioxidative (YVEEL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (YLLF) bioactive peptides on bone remodelling in ovariectomised (OVX) osteoporotic rat model. OVX animals were administered with antioxidative (AO) (500 μg kg−1 day−1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) (50 μg kg−1 day−1) peptides for eight weeks. Trabecular microarchitectural parameters of femoral and tibiae bone were determined using micro-CT scan. Bone formation, resorption, turnover markers (ALP, RANKL, OCN) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β, IFN-γ) were determined by ELISA. Both AO and ACE inhibitory peptides inhibited the increase in bone turnover and inflammatory cytokines while increased the bone formation markers. The altered morphometric parameters of femoral and tibiae bones due to OVX were strikingly attenuated by the peptide administration. The results indicated that AO peptide exerts more osteoprotective potential than ACE inhibitory peptide by suppressing inflammatory status and enhancing bone formation markers.	10.1039/C8FO00620B

This study was designed to clarify the mechanisms of hypocholesterolemic action of β-lactoglobuline tryptic hydrolysate (LTH) and to identify the novel hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from LTH by screening using Caco-2 cells and animal studies. Serum and liver cholesterol levels were significantly lower in rats fed LTH than in those fed casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH). The present study suggests that the inhibition of micellar solubility of cholesterol which causes the suppression of cholesterol absorption by a direct interaction between cholesterol mixed micelles, and LTH in the jejunal epithelia is part of the mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolemic action of LTH. Though no one could trace the hypocholesterolemic peptide to any protein origin, we identified, for the first time, a novel hypocholesterolemic peptide, Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu-Lys (IIAEK). Surprisingly, the present study provides the first direct evidence that a new hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from β-lactoglobuline can powerfully influence serum cholesterol levels and exhibit a greater hypocholesterolemic activity in comparison with that of medicine, β-sitosterol, in animal studies.	10.1006/bbrc.2001.4298

Whey proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides which may play a role in the dietary management of chronic diseases. Fractionation via ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the enrichment of antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg TH). UF processing selectively enhanced the biofunctional properties of β-Lg TH with the permeate obtained using a 1 kDa polyethersulfone (HFP-1) membrane having highest in vitro multifunctional bioactivity. Compared to β-Lg TH, the antioxidant activity was 1.7-fold higher (46,765 ± 2504 vs. 77,251 ± 5124 µmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dw; P < 0.05), DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased threefold (1.6 ± 0.31 vs. 0.53 ± 0.05 mg/mL; P < 0.05) and there was a twofold reduction in ACE IC50 (0.131 ± 0.005 vs. 0.068 ± 0.018 mg/mL; P < 0.05). The multifunctional peptide VAGTWY, β-Lg f(15–20) was shown to have potent antioxidant activity (5.63 µmol TE/µmol peptide). Two new ACE inhibitory peptides, IIAEK and IPAVFK, having IC50 values of 63.7 ± 7.22 and 144.8 ± 25.3 μM, respectively, were also identified in β-Lg TH. This study demonstrates the multifunctional bioactive properties of a β-Lg TH and its associated UF fractions.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.04.002

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X

ALPMH	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	158-162	ACE-inhibitory		521.0				Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of whey protein digests: concentration and characterization of active peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	The aim of this study was to identify whey-derived peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The bovine whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination. The total hydrolysates were fractionated in a two step ultrafiltration process, first with a 30 kDa membrane and then with a 1 kDa membrane. Inhibition of ACE was analysed spectrophotometrically. The peptides were isolated by chromatography and identified by mass and sequencing analysis. The most potent inhibitory peptides were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50 % inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345–1733 μg/ml. The IC50 values for the 1–30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 μg/ml and for the <1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77–1062 μM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were α-lactalbumin fractions (50–52), (99–108) and (104–108) and β-lactoglobulin fractions (22–25), (32–40), (81–83), (94–100), (106–111) and (142–146).	10.1017/s0022029999003982
ALPMH	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	158-162	Cholesterol regulation	Hypocholesterolemic					Identification of Novel Hypocholesterolemic Peptides Derived from Bovine Milk β-lactoglobulin	Nagaoka, S. et al.	This study was designed to clarify the mechanisms of hypocholesterolemic action of β-lactoglobuline tryptic hydrolysate (LTH) and to identify the novel hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from LTH by screening using Caco-2 cells and animal studies. Serum and liver cholesterol levels were significantly lower in rats fed LTH than in those fed casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH). The present study suggests that the inhibition of micellar solubility of cholesterol which causes the suppression of cholesterol absorption by a direct interaction between cholesterol mixed micelles, and LTH in the jejunal epithelia is part of the mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolemic action of LTH. Though no one could trace the hypocholesterolemic peptide to any protein origin, we identified, for the first time, a novel hypocholesterolemic peptide, Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu-Lys (IIAEK). Surprisingly, the present study provides the first direct evidence that a new hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from β-lactoglobuline can powerfully influence serum cholesterol levels and exhibit a greater hypocholesterolemic activity in comparison with that of medicine, β-sitosterol, in animal studies.	10.1006/bbrc.2001.4298
VLVLDTDYK	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	108-116	Antimicrobial			% Growth Inhibition	E. coli		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085
VLVLDTDYK	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	108-116	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	B. subtilis		Isolation and characterization of four bactericidal domains in the bovine β-lactoglobulin	Pellegrini, A. et al.	Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.	10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7

Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease involved in the degradation and inactivation of incretin hormones that act by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion after meal ingestion. DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity. These fractions were analysed by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify peptides responsible for the observed activity. The most potent fragment (IPAVF) corresponded to β-lactoglobulin f(78–82) which IC50 value was 44.7 μM. The results suggest that peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin would be beneficial ingredients of foods against type 2 diabetes.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.056

Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are useful strategies for managing, respectively, diabetes and hypertension, two conditions often occurring together. In this study, debittered and non-debittered whey protein hydrolysates (WPHs) were assessed for their in vitro inhibitory activity against ACE and DPP-IV and characterized for their constituent peptides. All WPHs and several fractions obtained from them had ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities, with ACE being generally more strongly inhibited than DPP-IV. Among the identified peptides tested, GYGGVSLPEW derived from α-lactalbumin and LKPTPEGDLE from β-lactoglobulin were, respectively, the most effective at inhibiting ACE (IC50 = 2 µM) and DPP-IV (IC50 = 42 µM). Although some identified peptides were able to inhibit both enzymes, the majority did not show a dual inhibitory effect. This research provides new insight on the active peptides responsible for the ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities of whey protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.jff.2015.11.038

TPEVDDEALEK	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	141-151	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	L. monocytogenes S. aureus		Antibacterial activity of peptides extracted from tryptic hydrolyzate of whey protein by nanofiltration	Demers-Mathieu, V. et al.	Ultrafiltration permeate of whey protein tryptic hydrolyzate was processed by nanofiltration (NF) to obtain retentate (NFR) and permeate (NFP) that were then tested as inhibitors of Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. NFR at 20 mg mL−1 was most effective as an inhibitor (P < 0.001); whereas E. coli was relatively resistant, the effect on Listeria and S. aureus was greater at 20 mg mL−1 than at 10 mg mL−1 (P < 0.01). Peptide analysis revealed that NFR was rich in anionic peptides over eight amino acid residues in length. The antibacterial activity of two anionic peptides (84–91 and 125–135) and a cationic peptide (36–42) derived from β-lactoglobulin was tested. Peptide 125–135 was more inhibitory (P < 0.05) than peptide 84–91 against Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus; peptide 36–42 was not inhibitory. NFR appears to have potential as a natural bio-preservative.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.09.003

Whey proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides which may play a role in the dietary management of chronic diseases. Fractionation via ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the enrichment of antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg TH). UF processing selectively enhanced the biofunctional properties of β-Lg TH with the permeate obtained using a 1 kDa polyethersulfone (HFP-1) membrane having highest in vitro multifunctional bioactivity. Compared to β-Lg TH, the antioxidant activity was 1.7-fold higher (46,765 ± 2504 vs. 77,251 ± 5124 µmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dw; P < 0.05), DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased threefold (1.6 ± 0.31 vs. 0.53 ± 0.05 mg/mL; P < 0.05) and there was a twofold reduction in ACE IC50 (0.131 ± 0.005 vs. 0.068 ± 0.018 mg/mL; P < 0.05). The multifunctional peptide VAGTWY, β-Lg f(15–20) was shown to have potent antioxidant activity (5.63 µmol TE/µmol peptide). Two new ACE inhibitory peptides, IIAEK and IPAVFK, having IC50 values of 63.7 ± 7.22 and 144.8 ± 25.3 μM, respectively, were also identified in β-Lg TH. This study demonstrates the multifunctional bioactive properties of a β-Lg TH and its associated UF fractions.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.04.002
LKPTPEGDLEIL	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	62-73	DPP-IV Inhibitory		57.0				Isolation and characterization of peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory activity from pepsin-treated bovine whey proteins	Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV is one of the strategies used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, pepsin-treated whey protein isolate (WPI) and α-lactalbumin displaying DPP-IV inhibitory activity were fractionated by successive chromatographic steps and the resulting active fractions analyzed for their constituent peptides by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 24 peptides derived from α-lactalbumin and 11 from β-lactoglobulin were synthesized and their effects on DPP-IV activity assessed. The most potent fragments, LKPTPEGDL and LKPTPEGDLEIL (IC50 = 45 and 57 μM, respectively), were found to inhibit DPP-IV in an un-competitive manner. Although several of the peptides tested showed some inhibitory activity, only two were as effective as the un-fractionated WPI hydrolysate and none were as potent as the un-fractionated α-lactalbumin hydrolysate. The peptides’ structural features, including length and amino acid composition, were found to impact their inhibitory activity. This study provides new insights on the active components responsible for the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of pepsin-treated whey proteins.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.01.002

LKPTPEGDL	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	62-70	DPP-IV Inhibitory						Investigation into the bioavailability of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitory activity using Caco-2 cell monolayers	Lacroix, IME. et al.	In recent years, peptides derived from a variety of dietary proteins have been reported to exhibit inhibitory activity against the dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme, a target in the management of type 2 diabetes. While much attention has been given to the production and identification of peptides with DPP-IV inhibitory activity from food proteins, particularly dairy proteins, little is known on the bioavailability of these molecules. In this study, the stability and transport of five previously identified milk-derived peptides (LKPTPEGDL, LPYPY, IPIQY, IPI and WR) and a whey protein isolate (WPI) digest with DPP-IV-inhibitory activity were investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayers as a model system for human intestinal absorption. Even though a small percentage (ranging from 0.05% for LPYPY to 0.47% for WR) of the bioactive peptides added to the apical side was able to cross the monolayer intact, all five peptides investigated were susceptible to peptidase action during the transport study. Conversely, only minor changes to the WPI digest composition were observed. Determination of the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the peptides and amino acids identified in the apical and basolateral solutions showed that most degradation products were less effective at inhibiting DPP-IV than the peptide they originated from. Findings from this research suggest that the susceptibility of food-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides to degradation by intestinal brush border membrane enzymes may alter their biological activity in vivo. Further research should be conducted to enhance the bioavailability of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides.	10.1039/c6fo01411a

Whey based peptides are well known for their nutritional and multifunctional properties. In this context, whey proteins from buffalo colostrum & milk were digested by in vitro simulation digestion and analyzed by nano-LC–MS/MS. Functional protein association networks, gene annotations and localization of identified proteins were carried out. An ACE inhibitory peptide sorted from the library was custom synthesized and an in vitro ACE assay was performed. The study led to the identification of 74 small peptides which were clustered into 5 gene functional groups and majority of them were secretory proteins. Among the identified peptides, majority of them were found identical to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and opioidal peptides. An octapeptide (m/z – 902.51, IQKVAGTW) synthesized was found to inhibit ACE with an IC50 of 300 ± 2 µM. The present investigation thus establishes newer vista for food derived peptides having ACE inhibitory potential for nutraceutical or therapeutic applications.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.032

Thus, after bromelain digestion followed by a 5 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration, WP hydrolysate with ACEI activity was fractioned by RP-HPLC; 2 out of 23 collected fractions retained ACEI activity and were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In the face of 128 identified peptides, molecular docking was carried out to prioritize peptides and to rationally guide the design of novel shorter and bioactive sequences. Therefore, 11 peptides, consisting of 3–6 amino acids and with molecular weights in the range from 399 to 674 Da, were rationally designed and then purchased to determine the IC50 value. This approach allowed the identification of two novel peptides: MHI and IAEK with IC50 ACEI values equal to 11.59 and 25.08 μM, respectively. Interestingly, we also confirmed the well-known ACEI IPAVF with an IC50 equal to 9.09 μM. In light of these results, this integrated approach could pave the way for high-throughput screening and identification of new peptides in dairy products. In addition, the herein proposed ACEI peptides could be exploited for novel applications both for food production and pharmaceuticals.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b06237
IPAVF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	94-98	DPP-IV Inhibitory		44.7				Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of a whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin	Silveira, ST. et al.	Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease involved in the degradation and inactivation of incretin hormones that act by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion after meal ingestion. DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity. These fractions were analysed by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify peptides responsible for the observed activity. The most potent fragment (IPAVF) corresponded to β-lactoglobulin f(78–82) which IC50 value was 44.7 μM. The results suggest that peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin would be beneficial ingredients of foods against type 2 diabetes.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.056
IPA	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	94-96	ACE-inhibitory		141.0				Structural analysis of new antihypertensive peptides derived from cheese whey protein by proteinase K digestion	Abubakar, A. et al.	"Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds
of proteases at 37°C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase
E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25°C (pepsin or
chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were
assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-
converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic
blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive
rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive
effect on the systolic blood pressure (–55 mm Hg)
was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the
whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Fi-
nally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated
from the proteinase K digest by a combination of
hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration.
The amino acid sequences and their origins were
clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [b-casein
(CN); f 59–64], Gly-Lys-Pro ( b2-microglobulin; f
18–20), Ile-Pro-Ala ( b-lactoglobulin; f 78–80), Phe-
Pro (serum albumin; f 221–222; b-CN, f 62–63, f
157–158, and f 205–206), Val-Tyr-Pro ( b-CN; f
59–61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-
Gln-Pro ( b-CN; f 80–90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an
undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in
spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic
tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from b-lactoglobu-
lin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity
(–31 mm Hg)."	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3

Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that whey proteins can reduce postprandial glucose levels and stimulate insulin release in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 2 diabetes by reducing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity in the proximal bowel and hence increasing intact incretin levels. Our aim was to identify DPP-4 inhibitors among short peptides occurring in hydrolysates of β-lactoglobulin, the major whey protein found in the milk of ruminants. We proved that the bioactive peptide Ile-Pro-Ala can be regarded as a moderate DPP-4 inhibitor.	10.1016/j.peptides.2011.01.002
LIVTQTMK	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	17-24	Cytotoxic	mice splenocyte					Proliferative effects of synthetic peptides from β-lactoglobulin and α-Lactalbumin on murine splenocytes	Jacquot, A. et al.	Eleven peptides, selected on the basis of physicochemical characteristics and their theoretical release from β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-La) by trypsin or chymotrypsin, were chemically synthesised to evaluate their immunomodulating properties. Murine splenocyte proliferation in the absence and presence of mitogen and different peptide concentrations were measured after 72–96 h incubations. β-Lg f78–83 had no effect on proliferation; β-Lg f15–20, f55–60, f84–91, f92–105, f139–148, f142–148 and α-La f10–16 stimulated proliferation to different extents; β-Lg f1–8, f102–105 and α-La f104–108 showed a cytotoxic effect. Regression analysis revealed the relationship of positive charge, hydrophobicity and length to the stimulatory proliferative effect. β-Lg f15–20, f55–60 and f139–148 also induced various inhibiting and/or stimulating effects on cytokine secretion. The results confirm that peptides releasable by digestive enzymes from α-La and β-Lg have the potential to influence the specific immune response through the modulation of splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.02.013
HIRL	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	162-165	Antianxiety						Effect of β-lactotensin on acute stress and fear memory	Yamauchi, R. et al.	β-Lactotensin (β-LT) is a bioactive peptide derived from bovine milk β-lactoglobulin and is a natural ligand for neurotensin receptors. We examined the effect of β-LT on restraint stress and fear memory in mice. Mice subjected to acute restraint stress exhibited a decreased number of head-dips and increased head-dip latency compared to non-stressed controls in the hole-board test, reflecting increased stress-induced behaviors. However, prior administration of β-LT improved the behaviors caused by stress. The anti-stress effect of β-LT was blocked by levocabastine, a neurotensin receptor subtype 2 (NTR2) antagonist. In the fear-conditioning test, the duration of freezing responses by cued fear conditioning was significantly reduced in mice administered β-LT compared with control mice. These results suggest that β-LT has an anti-stress effect and promotes the extinction of fear memory, which may be mediated by NTR2.	10.1016/j.peptides.2006.08.009

We have investigated the antioxidant activity of hydrolysates from whey proteins bovine α-lactalbumin (α-La) and β-lactoglobulin A (β-Lg A) by commercial proteases (pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and Corolase PP). Corolase PP was the most appropriate enzyme to obtain antioxidant hydrolysates from α-La and β-Lg A (ORAC−FL values of 2.315 and 2.151 μmol of Trolox equivalent/mg of protein, respectively). A total of 42 peptide fragments were identified by HPLC-MS/MS in the β-Lg A hydrolysate by Corolase PP. One of the sequences (Trp-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Ala-Met-Ala-Ala-Ser-Asp-Ile) possessed radical scavenging (ORAC−FL value of 2.621 μmol of Trolox equivalent/μmol of peptide) higher than that of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Our results suggest that whey protein hydrolysates could be suitable as natural ingredients in enhancing antioxidant properties of functional foods and in preventing oxidation reaction in food processing.	10.1021/jf048626m

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085

The antimicrobial potential of whey protein isolate hydrolyzed by gastrointestinal enzymes was determined by attempting to identify and characterize the antimicrobial peptides responsible. While tryptic and chymotryptic hydrolysates did not show antibacterial activity, whey proteins hydrolyzed for 45–90 min by pepsin exhibited significant activity. Fractionation of 60-min hydrolysate by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography yielded 5 fractions that were antibacterial, with minimum inhibitory concentrations comprised between 20 and 35 μg/mL. These fractions contained short peptides not previously identified as antimicrobial. Fragment 14–18 (KVAGT) of β-lactoglobulin is very close to a sequence previously identified as antibacterial and is found in antimicrobial sequences of diverse origin. Five other peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin, and one fragment from α-lactalbumin (f117–121, KVGIN), were also identified as antibacterial. The identified peptides do not match pepsin action exactly, indicating modified proteolysis of unknown origin. Protein by-products of the dairy industry offer potential for large-scale production of antimicrobial peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2013.01.014

Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.	10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7

In this work, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and radical-scavenging activities of the β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg)-derived peptides WY f(19−20), WYS f(19−21), WYSL f(19−22), WYSLA f(19−23), WYSLAM f(19−24), and WYSLAMA f(19−25) have been determined. The ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50) varied from 38.3 to 90.4 μM, with the exception of WYS (>500 μM). All β-Lg-derived peptides also exhibited radical-scavenging activity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values ranged from 4.45 to 7.67 μmol Trolox equivalents/μmol of peptide). The presence and position of amino acids Trp, Tyr, and Met were proposed to be responsible for the antioxidant activity. The equimolar amino acid mixtures of all the peptides showed ORAC values lower than those of the corresponding peptides, indicating that the peptidic bond or the structural conformation had a positive influence on this activity. Finally, positive antioxidant effects of WYS, WYSL, and WYLA with ascorbic acid were observed, whereas WY and WYSLAM showed negative effects, both cases for different molar ratio mixtures. These results should be taken into account in the development of new food ingredients on the basis of peptides from β-Lg.	10.1021/jf063427j

The present study was conducted to isolate and characterize anti-inflammatory peptides from whey protein hydrolysates using alcalase. Nine subfractions were obtained after sequential purification by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25 gel (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) filtration chromatography, and preparative HPLC. Among them, subfraction F4e showed the strongest inhibitory activity on interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Eight peptides, including 2 new peptides—Asp-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Tyr (DYKKY) and Asp-Gln-Trp-Leu (DQWL)—were identified from subfractions F4c and F4e, respectively, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide DQWL showed the strongest inhibitory ability on IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and TNF-α mRNA expression and production of IL-1β and TNF-α proteins at concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, DQWL treatment significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation by suppressing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 and blocking inhibitor κB kinase phosphorylation and inhibitor κB degradation together with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our study suggests that peptide DQWL has anti-inflammatory potential; further confirmation using an in vivo model is needed.	10.3168/jds.2016-11186

LF	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	120-121	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Isolation and characterization of anti-inflammatory peptides derived from whey protein	Ma, Y. et al.	The present study was conducted to isolate and characterize anti-inflammatory peptides from whey protein hydrolysates using alcalase. Nine subfractions were obtained after sequential purification by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25 gel (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) filtration chromatography, and preparative HPLC. Among them, subfraction F4e showed the strongest inhibitory activity on interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Eight peptides, including 2 new peptides—Asp-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Tyr (DYKKY) and Asp-Gln-Trp-Leu (DQWL)—were identified from subfractions F4c and F4e, respectively, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide DQWL showed the strongest inhibitory ability on IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and TNF-α mRNA expression and production of IL-1β and TNF-α proteins at concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, DQWL treatment significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation by suppressing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 and blocking inhibitor κB kinase phosphorylation and inhibitor κB degradation together with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our study suggests that peptide DQWL has anti-inflammatory potential; further confirmation using an in vivo model is needed.	10.3168/jds.2016-11186

In this work, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and radical-scavenging activities of the β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg)-derived peptides WY f(19−20), WYS f(19−21), WYSL f(19−22), WYSLA f(19−23), WYSLAM f(19−24), and WYSLAMA f(19−25) have been determined. The ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50) varied from 38.3 to 90.4 μM, with the exception of WYS (>500 μM). All β-Lg-derived peptides also exhibited radical-scavenging activity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values ranged from 4.45 to 7.67 μmol Trolox equivalents/μmol of peptide). The presence and position of amino acids Trp, Tyr, and Met were proposed to be responsible for the antioxidant activity. The equimolar amino acid mixtures of all the peptides showed ORAC values lower than those of the corresponding peptides, indicating that the peptidic bond or the structural conformation had a positive influence on this activity. Finally, positive antioxidant effects of WYS, WYSL, and WYLA with ascorbic acid were observed, whereas WY and WYSLAM showed negative effects, both cases for different molar ratio mixtures.

VLDTDYK	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	110-116	ACE-inhibitory		946.0				Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of whey protein digests: concentration and characterization of active peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	The aim of this study was to identify whey-derived peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The bovine whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination. The total hydrolysates were fractionated in a two step ultrafiltration process, first with a 30 kDa membrane and then with a 1 kDa membrane. Inhibition of ACE was analysed spectrophotometrically. The peptides were isolated by chromatography and identified by mass and sequencing analysis. The most potent inhibitory peptides were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50 % inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345–1733 μg/ml. The IC50 values for the 1–30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 μg/ml and for the <1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77–1062 μM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were α-lactalbumin fractions (50–52), (99–108) and (104–108) and β-lactoglobulin fractions (22–25), (32–40), (81–83), (94–100), (106–111) and (142–146).	10.1017/s0022029999003982
MKG	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	23-25	ACE-inhibitory		71.8				Effect of β-lactoglobulin hydrolysis with thermolysin under denaturing temperatures on the release of bioactive peptides	Hernandez-Ledesma, B. et al.	In this study, bovine β-lactoglobulin A (β-Lg A) was hydrolysed with thermolysin under non-denaturing and heat-denaturing conditions. The peptides released during hydrolysis were identified by HPLC–MS/MS. A total of 25 peptides were identified in the hydrolysate obtained at 37 °C for 5 min. Some of these peptides survived to further proteolysis even at higher incubation temperatures. Furthermore, novel cleavage sites localised in the most buried zones of β-Lg and available for thermolysin were recognised when the incubation temperature increased in the range between 60 and 80 °C. Three new peptides, LDA, LKPTPEGD, and LQKW, appeared after 30 min hydrolysis at these incubation temperatures, but they were not identified in the 30-min hydrolysates obtained at 37 and 50 °C. Of special interest was the peptide LQKW, corresponding to the fragment f(58–61) that had been previously described as a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor (IC50 value of 34.7 μM).	10.1016/j.chroma.2006.03.006
LSFNPTQ	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	165-171	ACE-inhibitory		106.0				Do whey protein-derived peptides have dual dipeptidyl-peptidase IV and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activities?	Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are useful strategies for managing, respectively, diabetes and hypertension, two conditions often occurring together. In this study, debittered and non-debittered whey protein hydrolysates (WPHs) were assessed for their in vitro inhibitory activity against ACE and DPP-IV and characterized for their constituent peptides. All WPHs and several fractions obtained from them had ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities, with ACE being generally more strongly inhibited than DPP-IV. Among the identified peptides tested, GYGGVSLPEW derived from α-lactalbumin and LKPTPEGDLE from β-lactoglobulin were, respectively, the most effective at inhibiting ACE (IC50 = 2 µM) and DPP-IV (IC50 = 42 µM). Although some identified peptides were able to inhibit both enzymes, the majority did not show a dual inhibitory effect. This research provides new insight on the active peptides responsible for the ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities of whey protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.jff.2015.11.038

Ovine and caprine β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) were isolated from sweet and acid whey by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. This method allowed a rapid purification of ovine and caprine β-Lg with high purity (higher than 92%), when starting from acid whey. These β-Lg preparations were digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase K and thermolysin and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was determined at different hydrolysis times. Consistently, higher activity was found in the hydrolysates prepared with enzymes of microbial origin. Four novel ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified from caprine β-Lg hydrolysed with thermolysin. The identified peptides were caprine β-Lg f(46–53), f(58–61), f(103–105), and f(122–125), with ACE-inhibitory activities (IC50) that ranged from 34.7 to 2470 μm.

LLF	P02756	Beta-lactoglobulin	Capra hircus	121-123	ACE-inhibitory		94.79				In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

This study sought to purify and identify a novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide from whey protein hydrolysed by trypsin. The peptide’s amino acid sequence, as well as the molecular mechanism of the interactions between the peptide and the ACE, were also studied. Using ultrafiltration, the hydrolysate was separated into three fractions. The fraction with molecular weight of <6 kDa had the greatest ACE inhibitory activity and was further separated by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and G-10 columns. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to separate the most active fraction. The amino acid sequence of the peptide with the greatest ACE inhibitory characteristics was confirmed as Leu–Leu (LL). The molecular mechanisms, position, type, and energy of the LL/ACE interaction were investigated by using flexible molecule docking technology.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.07.011

Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50 % inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345–1733 μg/ml. The IC50 values for the 1–30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 μg/ml and for the <1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77–1062 μM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were α-lactalbumin fractions (50–52), (99–108) and (104–108) and β-lactoglobulin fractions (22–25), (32–40), (81–83), (94–100), (106–111) and (142–146).	10.1017/s0022029999003982
IR	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	163-164	ACE-inhibitory		695.0				Structural Analysis of a New Anti-Hypertensive Peptide (β-Lactosin B) Isolated from a Commercial Whey Product	Murakami, M. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities and anti-hypertensive activities in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of 12 kinds of commercial peptides of food additive grade were measured. Four peptide products derived from milk proteins showed strong anti-hypertensive activities (>−18.0 mm Hg). A sample of WE80BG derived from whey proteins showed the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (−21.2 ± 16.9 mm Hg) with a medium level of ACE inhibitory activity (53.6%), and it was subjected to hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography. From the low molecular weight fraction, an anti-hypertensive peptide was isolated by using reversed-phase HPLC, and it was found to be a tetrapeptide, alanine-leucine-proline-methionine (Ala-Leu-Pro-Met, ALPM), the origin of which was estimated to be β-lactoglobulin f 142 to 145. At 8 h after oral administration of ALPM in SHR, systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased (−21.4 ± 7.8 mm Hg), but the IC50 value (concentration of peptide needed to inhibit 50% of the ACE activity) of ALPM was not so high. We named the Ala-Leu-Pro-Met “β-lactosin B.” This peptide is the second anti-hypertensive peptide found from β-lactoglobulin. Because WE80BG containing ALPM was also found to show the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (−24.5 ± 10 mm Hg) at 8 h after oral administration in SHR, WE80BG would be suitable for application to the development of a new food expected to have anti-hypertensive effects.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(04)70013-2

GTW	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	33-35	ACE-inhibitory		464.4				Purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides and antihypertensive effect of milk produced by protease-facilitated lactic fermentation	Chen, G-W. et al.	Fresh low-fat milk was fermented with five mixed lactic acid bacteria for up to 30 h at 42 °C. A protease, prozyme 6, was added 5 h after the beginning of fermentation. The whey was separated from the fermented milk and freeze-dried. As the fermentation time extended to 30 h, soluble protein content increased from 30.9 to 195.9 mg g−1, free amino acid content increased from 2.8 to 192.8 mg g−1, peptide content increased from 6.4 to 402.8 mg g−1 and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased from 0 to 80.6 mg 100 g−1, while inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) increased as indicated by a decrease of IC50 from 1.18 to 0.24 mg mL−1, respectively. The amino acid sequences of two ACE inhibitory peptides were Gly–Thr–Trp and Gly–Val–Trp, of which the IC50 values were 464.4 and 240.0 μm, respectively. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were reduced 22 and 21.5 mm Hg, respectively, after 8 weeks of oral administration of diluted whey (peptide concentration 5 mg mL−1) from the 30 h fermentation.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2006.07.004
DAQSAPLRVY	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	49-58	ACE-inhibitory		11.62				The Portuguese Paradox: Why do some inhabitants of Portugal appear to live so long when their diet is based on whey cheese?	Tavares, TG. et al.	The remarkable longevity of people in specific regions of Portugal, whose diets are based on whey cheese, has puzzled researchers for quite some time. Our data indicate that several oligopeptides are released from glycomacropeptide (originated in κ-casein) and α-lactalbumin – and one surprisingly from β-lactoglobulin, by plant proteases previously used in cheesemaking. A few of such peptides (e.g. DKVGINYW, KGYGGVSLPEW and DAQSAPLRVY) exhibit unusually strong antihypertensive roles in vitro, following generation in situ or synthesis de novo. The activities of the latter two are not significantly affected by simulated gastrointestinal digestion, despite undergoing partial hydrolysis. This piece of information is rather promising toward more comprehensive attempts to scientifically rationalise this Portuguese Paradox.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.09.052
DAQSAPLRVY	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	49-58	ACE-inhibitory		12.2				Novel whey-derived peptides with inhibitory effect against angiotensin-converting enzyme: In vitro effect and stability to gastrointestinal enzymes	Tavares, TG. et al.	Whey protein concentrate (WPC) was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by proteases from the flowers of Cynara cardunculus, and the resulting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect was monitored. The whole WPC hydrolysate exhibited an IC50 value of 52.9 ± 2.9 μg/mL, whereas the associated peptide fraction with molecular weight below 3 kDa scored 23.6 ± 1.1 μg/mL. The latter fraction was submitted to RP-HPLC, and 6 fractions were resolved that exhibited ACE-inhibitory effects. Among the various peptides found, a total of 14 were identified via sequencing with an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Eleven of these peptides were synthesized de novo – to validate their ACE-inhibitory effect, and also to ascertain their stability when exposed to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Among them, three novel, highly potent peptides were found, corresponding to α-lactalbumin f(16–26) – with the sequence KGYGGVSLPEW, α-lactalbumin f(97–104) with DKVGINYW, and β-lactoglobulin f(33–42) with DAQSAPLRVY; their IC50 values were as low as 0.80 ± 0.1, 25.2 ± 1.0 and 13.0 ± 1.0 μg/mL, respectively. None of them remained stable in the presence of gastrointestinal enzymes: they were partially, or even totally hydrolyzed to smaller peptides – yet the observed ACE-inhibitory effects were not severely affected for two of those peptides.	10.1016/j.peptides.2011.02.005
CMENSA	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	122-127	ACE-inhibitory		788.0				Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of whey protein digests: concentration and characterization of active peptides	Pihlanto-Leppala, A. et al.	The aim of this study was to identify whey-derived peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The bovine whey proteins α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination.

YVEEL	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	58-62	Osteoanabolic						Osteoanabolic activity of whey-derived anti-oxidative (MHIRL and YVEEL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (YLLF, ALPMHIR, IPA and WLAHK) bioactive peptides	Pandey, M. et al.	Exploring bone rebuilding anabolic agents has been gaining much attention due to their potential therapeutic effects in treating several bone disorders including osteoporosis. Whey protein has been reported to affect bone health osteoanabolically, in terms of proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells. This study investigates whether whey derived anti-oxidative (AO) (P1- MHIRL, P2- YVEEL) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) (P3- YLLF, P4-ALPMHIR, P5-IPA, P6- WLAHK) bioactive peptides affect the proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells isolated from rat calvaria. The proliferation and osteogenic activity of osteoblast cells in presence of these peptides were determined by MTT assay, DNA quantification study, Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and ALP staining, Alizarin red activity and staining, and secretory osteocalcin measurement. The expression of osteogenesis-related genes (COLI-α, ALP, OCN and RUNX2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis over a period of 21 days. The peptide treated osteoblasts showed a significant increase in viable cell density and proliferation in the order of P2 > P6 > P3 at optimised concentration. Furthermore, the osteoblastic differentiation markers in response to these peptides were found to be significantly up regulated in the order of P2 > P6 > P3 when compared to the controls. These results demonstrated that bioactive whey-derived AO and ACE inhibitory peptides can play a potential therapeutic role in osteoporosis by activating osteoblasts anabolically.	10.1016/j.peptides.2017.11.004

Milk contains various bioactive components with osteoanabolic properties. This study investigates the comparative effect of the whey-derived antioxidative (YVEEL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (YLLF) bioactive peptides on bone remodelling in ovariectomised (OVX) osteoporotic rat model. OVX animals were administered with antioxidative (AO) (500 μg kg−1 day−1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) (50 μg kg−1 day−1) peptides for eight weeks. Trabecular microarchitectural parameters of femoral and tibiae bone were determined using micro-CT scan. Bone formation, resorption, turnover markers (ALP, RANKL, OCN) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β, IFN-γ) were determined by ELISA. Both AO and ACE inhibitory peptides inhibited the increase in bone turnover and inflammatory cytokines while increased the bone formation markers. The altered morphometric parameters of femoral and tibiae bones due to OVX were strikingly attenuated by the peptide administration. The results indicated that AO peptide exerts more osteoprotective potential than ACE inhibitory peptide by suppressing inflammatory status and enhancing bone formation markers.	10.1039/C8FO00620B
YVEELKPTPEGDL	P02755	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bubalus bubalis	60-72	Antioxidant						Antioxidant Properties of Buffalo-Milk Dairy Products: A β-Lg Peptide Released after Gastrointestinal Digestion of Buffalo Ricotta Cheese Reduces Oxidative Stress in Intestinal Epithelial Cells	Basilicata, MG. et al.	Redox signaling regulates different gastrointestinal (G.I.) epithelium functions. At the intestinal level, the loss of redox homeostasis in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is responsible for the pathogenesis and development of a wide diversity of G.I. disorders. Thus, the manipulation of oxidative stress in IECs could represent an important pharmacological target for different diseases. In this study, peptides released from in vitro gastro intestinal digestion of different buffalo-milk commercial dairy products were identified and evaluated for their bioactive properties. In particular, six G.I. digests of dairy products were tested in a model of oxidative stress for IECs. Among them, buffalo ricotta cheese was the most active and the presence of an abundant β-lactoglobulin peptide (YVEELKPTPEGDL, f:60-72) was also revealed. The antioxidant potential of the identified peptide was also evaluated in a model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in the IEC-6 cell line. The peptide was able to reduce ROS release, while, on the other hand, it increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation and the expression of antioxidant cytoprotective factors, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results indicate that buffalo ricotta cheese-isolated peptide could have potential in the treatment of some gastrointestinal disorders.	10.3390/ijms19071955

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991

IPAV	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	94-97	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					A novel whey tetrapeptide IPAV reduces interleukin-8 production induced by TNF-α in human intestinal Caco-2 cells	Oyama, M. et al.	In the present study, an anti-inflammatory effect of enzymatic whey protein hydrolysate was examined in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced interleukin (IL)-8 expression through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B p65, spleen tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways. Pre-treatment of cells with whey protein hydrolysate reduced TNF-α-induced IL-8 expression. Mass spectrometry analysis has identified the active tetrapeptide IPAV, which corresponded to amino acids 94–97 of β-lactoglobulin. Pre-treatment of cells with IPAV reduced TNF-α-induced IL-8 expression and the increase in phosphorylation levels of key cellular signalling proteins. Pharmacological inhibition of peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), but not of calcium-sensing receptor, attenuated IPAV-mediated suppression of IL-8 expression. In summary, a novel anti-inflammatory tetrapeptide IPAV, derived from whey protein hydrolysate, reduced IL-8 expression induced by TNF-α. Our results suggest that IPAV, transported by PepT1, can suppress inflammatory signalling in intestinal cells.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.06.001
PEQSLACQCL	P02756	Beta-lactoglobulin	Capra hircus	131-140	ACE-inhibitory						Novel angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from caseins and whey proteins of goat milk	Lin, K. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in blood pressure regulation by producing the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The inhibition of ACE with natural inhibitors, as alternatives to avoid the side effect of synthetic drugs, is a major target in the prevention of hypertension. In this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides. Digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACE compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins. The hydrolysates were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography, Sephacryl S-100 column, into four fractions (F1–F4). The late-eluting fraction (F4) of either whey or caseins exhibited greater ACE inhibition. Peptides in both F4 fractions, isolated by RP-HPLC, exhibited variable ACE inhibitory activities with the hydrophobic peptide peaks being the most potent ACE inhibitors. MALDI-TOF MS/MS resulted in identification of three potent ACE inhibitory peptides: PEQSLACQCL from β-lactoglobulin (residues 113–122), QSLVYPFTGPI from β-casein (residues 56–66), and ARHPHPHLSFM from κ-casein (residues 96–106). The peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACE inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting IC50 values of 4.45 μM and 4.27 μM, respectively. The results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACE-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.	10.1016/j.jare.2016.12.002

Besides their nutritional value, whey protein (WP) peptides are food components retaining important pharmacological properties for controlling hypertension. We herein report how the use of complementary experimental and theoretical investigations allowed the identification of novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) peptides obtained from a WP hydrolysate and addressed the rational design of even shorter sequences based on molecular pruning. Thus, after bromelain digestion followed by a 5 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration, WP hydrolysate with ACEI activity was fractioned by RP-HPLC; 2 out of 23 collected fractions retained ACEI activity and were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In the face of 128 identified peptides, molecular docking was carried out to prioritize peptides and to rationally guide the design of novel shorter and bioactive sequences. Therefore, 11 peptides, consisting of 3–6 amino acids and with molecular weights in the range from 399 to 674 Da, were rationally designed and then purchased to determine the IC50 value. This approach allowed the identification of two novel peptides: MHI and IAEK with IC50 ACEI values equal to 11.59 and 25.08 μM, respectively. Interestingly, we also confirmed the well-known ACEI IPAVF with an IC50 equal to 9.09 μM. In light of these results, this integrated approach could pave the way for high-throughput screening and identification of new peptides in dairy products. In addition, the herein proposed ACEI peptides could be exploited for novel applications both for food production and pharmaceuticals.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b06237

GLDIQKVAGT	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	25-34	Antimicrobial						Modulation of Virulence Gene Expression in Salmonella enterica subsp enterica typhimurium by Synthetic Milk-Derived Peptides	Ali, E. et al.	The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2
PMHIR	P02754	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	160-164	ACE-inhibitory						Novel  ACE  inhibitory  peptides  derived  from  whey  protein  hydrolysates-  Identification  and  molecular  docking	Li, X.  et al.	Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a significant role in the regulation of blood pressure via generating angiotensin II (Ang II). Using natural inhibitors to block the activity of ACE is an alternative method to minimize the side effects of commercial drugs, and is a major goal of hypertension management. This study detected the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides in whey protein hydrolysate. The whey protein hydrolysate was separated sequentially by ultrafiltration and RP-HPLC. LC-MS/MS revealed the amino acid sequences of the fractions and four potential ACE inhibitory peptides were selected (PQVSTPTL, MPGP, PMHIR, PPLT) for synthesis. IC50 values of these four peptides were 86 ± 8, 179 ± 4, 90 ± 6, and 168 ± 4 μM, respectively. Then, molecular docking analysis was used to assess how these peptides interact with ACE. PQVSTPTL exhibited the lowest binding energy (−6.64 kcal/mol) with the ACE molecule. These four reported peptides were with no allergenicity nor toxicity. These results indicated that whey protein hydrolysate could be a suitable resource for obtaining novel inhibitory peptides against ACE and provides information for obtaining novel ACE inhibitors for hypertension management.	10.1016/j.fbio.2022.101737

The goat milk fermented with L60 was characterized with strong DPPH radical scavenging activity, high viable count, satisfactory acidity and good stability after gastrointestinal digestion. Fractions of L60 fermented goat milk were purified through a successive of ultrafiltration, Sephadex and Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) technologies, and evaluated by the DPPH radical assay, hydroxyl free radical assay and Fe2+ chelating ability. Three novel antioxidative peptides were obtained subsequently and identified as VGINYWLAHK, TPEVDKEALEK and DLLER. The application of purified peptides in goat milk powder showed significantly increased antioxidant capacities. Our study provided a roadmap for a more comprehensive description of the antioxidant capacity of goat milk fermented by a novel L. plantarum 60.	10.1016/j.lwt.2020.110162
KALPMHIRLAF	P67976	Beta-lactoglobulin-1/B	Ovis aries	159-169	ACE-inhibitory		11.0				Quantitative structureeactivity relationship based screening of bioactive peptides identified in ripened cheese	Sagardia, I. et al.	The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006

The milk protein proteose peptone component 3 (PP3, also known as lactophorin) is a small phosphoglycoprotein, which is exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland. A 23-residue synthetic peptide (lactophoricin, Lpcin S), corresponding to the C-terminal amphipathic α-helix of PP3, has previously been shown to permeabilize membranes and display antibacterial activity. Lactophorin readily undergoes proteolytic cleavage in milk and during dairy processing, and it has been suggested that PP3-derived peptides are part of milk's endogenous defense system against bacteria. Here, we report that a 26-residue C-terminal peptide (Lpcin P) can be generated by trypsin proteolysis of PP3 and that structural and functional studies of Lpcin P indicate that the peptide has antibacterial properties. The Lpcin P showed α-helical structure in both anionic and organic solvents, and the amount of α-helical structure was increased in the presence of lipid vesicles. Oriented circular dichroism showed that Lpcin P oriented parallel to the membrane surface. However, the peptide permeabilized calcein-containing vesicles efficiently. Lpcin P displayed antibacterial activity against Streptococcus thermophilus, but not against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The PP3 full-length protein did not display the same properties, which could indicate that PP3 functions as a precursor protein that upon proteolysis, releases a bioactive antibacterial peptide.	10.3168/jds.2011-4837

IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory		5.0				Release of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides during in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion of camel milk	Tagliazucchi, D. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides released from camel milk after simulated gastro-intestinal digestion were identified. The hydrolysis degree increased during digestion. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the post-pancreatic <3 kDa fraction. Peptides responsible for the biological activity were isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 17 were identical to known bioactive peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity. Based on previous structure–activity relationship studies, the sequence of some peptides allowed us to anticipate the presence of biological activities. The anti-hypertensive tripeptide isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) was identified and quantified in digested camel milk. The amount of released IPP was 2.56 ± 0.15 mg L−1 of milk. For the first time, we showed that IPP is released during the gastro-intestinal digestion of camel milk κ-casein. This research provides the basis to increase the exploitation of the health benefits of camel milk.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.01.009
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory						Hemodynamic Effects of Lactotripeptides from Casein Hydrolysate in Mediterranean Normotensive Subjects and Patients with High-Normal Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Clinical Trial	Cicero, AFG. et al.	Contrasting data partially support a certain antihypertensive efficacy of lactotripeptides derived from enzymatic treatment of casein hydrolysate. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical study to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy of a short-term treatment with lactotripeptides in Mediterranean subjects with normal or high-normal blood pressure (BP). We consecutively enrolled 55 untreated subjects (men:women = 30:25), 40.3 ± 9.8 years old, with normal or high-normal BP. After 4 weeks of dietary standardization, they were allocated to treatment with a fruit juice containing 3 mg of added Ile-Pro-Pro/Val-Pro-Pro lactotripeptides or with placebo for 4 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, they were then assigned to the alternative treatment for a further period of 4 weeks. Overall, no significant difference has been observed in office BP comparing baseline data with those posttreatment. Repeating the analysis by basal BP level, a mild but significant reduction in systolic BP (−1.7 ± 2.3 mm Hg; t = 3.5, P = .002) has been observed only in subjects with high-normal BP after treatment with lactotripeptides. With regard to 24-hour BP measurement, after lactotripeptide treatment only, the subjects experienced a significant reduction in diurnal diastolic BP (−1.6 ± 5.4 mm Hg; P = .042), diurnal mean BP (−2.1 ± 5.9 mm Hg; P = .19), and 24-hour (−5.4 ± 14.2 mm Hg; P = .011) and diurnal (−7.1 ± 19.2%; P = .014) diastolic BP value measurements relative to normal values. No modification has been observed in relation to plasma renin activity and aldosteronemia. In conclusion, diurnal diastolic BP is significantly reduced by lactrotripeptide supplementation in untreated Mediterranean subjects with normal or high-normal BP. Office systolic BP is reduced only in subjects with high-normal BP.	10.1089/jmf.2009.0253
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory		11.6				ACE-inhibitory activity of probiotic yoghurt	Donkor, ON. et al.	In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009

In this study, we constructed a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory tripeptides from published data (R2 = 0.8437; Q2 = 0.649) and applied the model to screen 27 tripeptides derived from cow milk protein sequences. Potential ACE inhibitory tripeptides were synthesised and evaluated in in vitro/in vivo studies. Results showed that ACE inhibitory activities of tripeptides followed the order (p < 0.05): isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP, commercial) > valine-isoleucine-proline (VIP) > isoleucine-valine-proline (IVP) based on concentrations (7.57–49.72 μm) that decreased 50% of ACE activity. Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) effect of tripeptides in rats (1.5 mg kg−1 body weight dosage) followed the order according to relative lowering SBP rates: IVP (24%) > IPP (17%) > VIP (12%), consistent with results on mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Mg2+ -ATPase gene in rat hearts (p < 0.05). IPP and IVP showed no negative effects on blood glycometabolism.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.10.009
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory						Characterization of casein-derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory						Biological effects of casein-derived tripeptide powders are not affected by fermentation process	Jakala, P. et al.	Milk casein-derived biologically active tripeptides isoleucine–proline–proline and valine–proline–proline have shown antihypertensive effects both in animal and clinical studies. Contradictory findings from clinical intervention studies may be related to different manufacturing processes. The present study aimed to compare cardiovascular effects of two different tripeptide powders in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Rats received tripeptide powders produced either by Lactobacillus helveticus fermentation (A) or Lb. helveticus plus proline specific endoprotease (B) in drinking fluid for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was recorded weekly. At the end, blood and tissue samples were collected and arterial responses studied. Blood pressure was 13.6 and 14.2 mmHg lower in the groups A and B, respectively, versus the water group (P < 0.01). Vascular responses of aorta and mesenteric artery did not differ between the groups. Both tripeptide products increased urinary cGMP (P < 0.001) and decreased albumin (P < 0.05). The fermentation process did not influence the cardiovascular effects of the tripeptide powders.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.11.017
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory		2.4				Antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro	Yamada, A. et al.	The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	ACE-inhibitory		5.0				Purification and Characterization of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors from Sour Milk	Nakamura, Y. et al.	The inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme in milk increased during fermentation with the Calpis sour milk starter containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two kinds of peptides inhibitory to angiotensin I-converting enzyme were purified from the sour milk by using four-step HPLC. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were identified as Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro. The concentrations of peptides providing 50% inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were 9 and 5 microM, respectively. Most of the inhibitory activity in sour milk was attributed to these two peptides.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(95)76689-9
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	Antihypertensive						Production of an antihypertensive peptide from milk by the brown rot fungus Neolentinus lepideus	Okamoto K. et al.	Fermented milk has been shown to have beneficial effects on human health exerted through its bioactive peptides. The lactose-fermenting brown rot fungus Neolentinus lepideus has been shown to ferment milk; however, its ability to produce bioactive peptides has not been explored. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the ability N. lepideus for the production of antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk and to characterize the peptides. Here we have used 9% skim milk as the substrate and fermented it with the mycelia of N. lepideus. The fermented milk exhibited higher angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity as compared to the commercially available sour milk containing Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro. As a result of isolation and purification by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by peptide sequencing and MS analysis, the dipeptide Tyr-Pro (YP) was identified as an active peptide. The concentration of YP in the fermented milk reached up to 450 μg/ml, which was > twofold higher than the IC50 for ACE inhibition. Subsequently, the antihypertensive effect of YP was validated through intravenous injection of the peptide, which exhibited a significant lowering of blood pressure in a rat model of genetic hypertension. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis revealed the probable role of the carboxypeptidases for the increased yield of YP. These results together indicated that the fermentation with basidiomycete fungus could be a viable approach to produce bioactive peptides, and may, therefore, be applicable in the development of a cost-effective mass production system for functional peptides.	10.1007/s00217-020-03530-y
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	Antioxidant						Milk-derived tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) differentially modulate angiotensin II effects on vascular smooth muscle cells	Chakrabarti, S. et al.	Hyperactivity of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is a hallmark of hypertension. Angiotensin II (AngII), the active component of RAS, not only promotes vasoconstriction but also contributes to proliferation, inflammation and oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that predispose to atherosclerosis. Milk derived bioactive peptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) exert anti-hypertensive effects through RAS modulation. Here we evaluated the ability of these peptides to attenuate the effects of AngII on cultured VSMC. We found that VPP significantly inhibited AngII induced cell proliferation, inflammation and oxidative stress while IPP only showed anti-oxidant actions. Both peptides abolished AngII mediated activation of pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway but only VPP could attenuate activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2. These results demonstrate differential modulation of AngII actions on VSMC by anti-hypertensive milk peptides and indicate the potential for VPP in mitigating the vascular complications of hypertension.	10.1016/j.jff.2016.12.022
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	Enhance insulin signaling						Milk-Derived Tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) Enhance Insulin Sensitivity and Prevent Insulin Resistance in 3T3-F442A Preadipocytes	Chakrabarti, S. et al.	There is great interest in developing naturally derived compounds, especially bioactive peptides with potential insulin sensitizing effects and/or preventing insulin resistance. Previously, we showed adipogenic and insulin mimetic actions of IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro), the milk-derived tripeptides on cultured preadipocytes, in addition to their previously characterized antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory functions. However, the effect of these peptides on insulin signaling is not known. Therefore, we examined IPP and VPP effects on insulin signaling in preadipocytes, a well-established model for studying insulin signaling. Our results suggested both peptides enhanced insulin signaling and contributed toward the prevention of insulin resistance in the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Inhibition of inflammatory mediator NF-kB under TNF stimulation was a likely contributor to the prevention of insulin resistance. VPP further enhanced the expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes and restored glucose uptake in TNF-treated adipocytes. Our data suggested the potential of these peptides in the management of conditions associated with impairments in insulin signaling.	10.1021/acs.jafc.8b02051
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Characterization of casein derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976
IPP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-131	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Milk-Derived Tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) Promote Adipocyte Differentiation and Inhibit Inflammation in 3T3-F442A Cells	Chakrabarti, S. et al.	Milk derived tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) have shown promise as anti-hypertensive agents due to their inhibitory effects on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Due to the key inter-related roles of hypertension, chronic inflammation and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, there is growing interest in investigating established anti-hypertensive agents for their effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation. In this study, we examined the effects of IPP and VPP on 3T3-F442A murine pre-adipocytes, a widely used model for studying metabolic diseases. We found that both IPP and VPP induced beneficial adipogenic differentiation as manifested by intracellular lipid accumulation, upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and secretion of the protective lipid hormone adiponectin by these cells. The observed effects were similar to those induced by insulin, suggesting potential benefits in the presence of insulin resistance. IPP and VPP also inhibited cytokine induced pro-inflammatory changes such as reduction in adipokine levels and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that IPP and VPP exert insulin-mimetic adipogenic effects and prevent inflammatory changes in adipocytes, which may offer protection against metabolic disease	10.1371/journal.pone.0117492

Food-derived bioactive peptides are reported to express a variety of functions in vivo. We studied the in vitro effect of three bioactive tripeptides, isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP), valine-proline-proline (VPP) and leucine-lysine-proline (LKP), on osteoblast proliferation and gene expression. We used UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells, human marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and osteoblasts differentiated from hMSC. Treatment with 50 μm-IPP increased UMR-106 cell and hMSC proliferation. The gene expression of hMSC-differentiated osteoblasts was analysed by the microarray method. Microarray analysis revealed that IPP up-regulated 270 genes and down-regulated 100 genes. VPP and LKP, by contrast, had a very modest influence on osteoblast gene expression. Real-time PCR confirmed that IPP up-regulated PTHrP, BMP-5 and CREB-5 and down-regulated VDR and caspase-8. IPP possesses potential to increase osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and signalling. Agents that increase the number and function of osteoblasts could improve bone mass and structure, and decrease fracture risk.	10.1017/S0007114507744434

Lactobacillus (L.) helveticus fermented milk attenuates the development of hypertension through its bioactive peptides. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether L. helveticus and its components affect bone in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHR (n = 10/group) received either 1) L. helveticus fermented milk high in isoleucyl-prolyl-proline (IPP) and valyl-prolyl-proline (VPP) peptides, 2) normal sour milk, 3) synthesised IPP and VPP peptides in water, or 4) water, ad libitum for 12 weeks. After the intervention, bone mineral density and bone mineral content were measured of the right femur by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Ash weight, and calcium and phosphate content of the ashes were measured. Static histomorphometrical measurements were taken from the tibia. The L. helveticus group showed 34% higher bone volume than the water group (p = 0.066). The trabecular thickness was 17% higher in the L. helveticus group (p = 0.025) and 10% higher in the peptide group (p = 0.025) than in the water group. There was no difference in the bone mineral density between the L. helveticus and the water group. Long-term feeding with L. helveticus fermented milk supports trabecular bone in growing SHR. This effect may be dependent on the bioactive peptides formed during fermentation.	N/A

The blood-pressure-lowering effect of bovine κ-casein macropeptide (CMP), previously reported to exhibit a modest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro, was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The oral administration of CMP (150 mg kg−1) significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR. The antihypertensive action was more pronounced when CMP was treated with trypsin. The sequence MAIPPKK, identified in the tryptic hydrolysate of bovine CMP, significantly reduced blood pressure at a dose of 10 mg kg−1. The CMP and its tryptic peptides induced relaxation of endothelium-intact aortic rings. The sequence MAIPPKK also evoked a significant relaxation effect; however, the shorter sequence MAIPPK and the strong ACE-inhibitory tripeptide IPP exhibited a vascular relaxing effect lower than 10%. The implications of vascular relaxing mechanisms, as well as the possibility that the tripeptide IPP is at least partially responsible for the antihypertensive effects of CMP, are discussed.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.009

Methods : E. faecalis strain JKD 15036 was exposed to different concentrations of KCGP and KCP in a 96-well culture plate. The effect of the peptides on the growth of E. faecalis in planktonic culture was monitored by measuring optical density over 7 hours. Biofilm formation was measured after 24 hours using a crystal violet assay. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Results : KCGP and KCP inhibited growth of E. faecalis in planktonic culture with no significant difference in activity between the peptides. KCGP at 0.16% w/v was significantly better at inhibiting E. faecalis biofilm formation than KCP at the same concentration and significantly better than NaOCl at 1.0% w/v.

Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a heterogeneous C-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk κ-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. We have demonstrated that CMP has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens Streptococcus mutans andPorphyromonas gingivalis and against Escherichia coli. CMP was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and each fraction was tested for activity against S. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. Fractions were characterized by N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. The active form of CMP was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated κ-casein (residues 106 to 169) [κ-casein(106–169)], which we have designated kappacin. Endoproteinase Glu-C was used to hydrolyze CMP, and the generated peptides were separated using RP-HPLC and gel filtration-HPLC and then tested for activity against S. mutans. The peptide Ser(P)149κ-casein-A(138–158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase Glu-C digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide Ser(P)149κ-casein-A(138–158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart κ-casein-A(138–158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. The synthetic Ser(P)149 κ-casein-A(138–158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against S. mutans(MIC, 59 μg/ml [26 μM]). The nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.	10.1128/AAC.45.8.2309-2315.2001

"Background and purpose: Bovine glycomacropeptide (BGMP) is a natural milk peptide that is produced naturally in the gastrointestinal tract during digestion. Glycomacropepide has intestinal anti-inflammatory activity, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Here we have characterized the effects of BGMP on monocytes.

Experimental approach: We have used human THP-1 cells as an in vitro monocyte model. The effect of BGMP on the secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 was assessed, as well as the involvement of the NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling pathways. The stimulatory effect of BGMP was also tested in human peripheral blood monocytes.

Key results: BGMP up-regulated the secretion of TNF, IL-1β and IL-8 in a concentration-dependent fashion. The biological activity was exerted by the intact peptide, because cytokine secretion was not affected by protease inhibitors. The secretion of IL-8 and specially TNF and IL-1β was blocked by PD98059, SP600125, SB203580 and Bay11-7082, suggesting the involvement of the MAP kinases p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and ERK and particularly the NF-κB pathway, although IL-8 secretion was independent of p38. BGMP was shown to elicit the phosphorylation of IκB-α and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65. The effect of BGMP on cytokine secretion was validated in human primary blood monocytes.

Conclusions and implications: BGMP stimulates human monocytes, operating via MAP kinase and NF-κB pathways. BGMP may exert an indirect intestinal anti-inflammatory effect by potentiating host defences against invading microorganisms."	10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00195.x

Background. Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), a major worldwide concern for the public health system, refers to a cluster of key metabolic components, and represents a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. As oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation are the major triggers of insulin sensitivity (IS), a cardinal MetS feature, the principal aim of the present work is to determine whether glycomacropeptide (GMP), a milk-derived bioactive peptide, exerts beneficial effects on their expression. Methods. Fully differentiated intestinal Caco-2/15 cells are used to evaluate the preventive action of 2 mg/mL GMP against OxS and inflammation induced by the mixture iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) (200 μM:2 mM). The potency of GMP of decreasing the production of lipoproteins, including chylomicrons (CM), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is also assessed. Results. The administration of GMP significantly reduces malondialdehyde, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, and raises superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase via the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2, a transcription factor, which orchestrates cellular antioxidant defenses. Similarly, GMP markedly lowers the inflammatory agents tumor necrosis factor-α and cyclooxygenase-2 via abrogation of the nuclear transcription factor-kB. Moreover, GMP-treated cells show a down-regulation of Fe/Asc-induced mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, suggesting greater IS. Finally, GMP decreases the production of CM, VLDL, and LDL. Conclusions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of GMP in attenuating OxS, inflammation and lipoprotein biogenesis, as well as improving IS, the key components of MetS. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms mediating the preventive action of GMP.	10.3390/nu12041175

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced enteropathy is considered a serious and increasing clinical problem without available treatment. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a 64-amino acid peptide derived from milk κ-casein with numerous biological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of GMP on NSAID enteropathy in rats. Enteropathy was induced by seven days oral indomethacin administration. Rats were orally GMP treated from seven days previous and during the establishment of the enteropathy model. Changes in metabolism, hematological and biochemical blood alterations, intestinal inflammation and oxidative damage were analyzed. Integrity barrier markers, macroscopic intestinal damage and survival rate were also evaluated. GMP treatment prevented anorexia and weight loss in animals. Furthermore, prophylaxis with GMP ameliorated the decline in hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin and total protein levels. The treatment had no therapeutic efficacy on the decrease of occludin and mucin (MUC)-2 expression in intestinal tissue. However, GMP markedly decreased neutrophil infiltration, and CXCL1, interleukin-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Nitric oxide production and lipid hydroperoxide level in the small intestine were also diminished. These beneficial effects were mirrored by preventing ulcer development and increasing animal survival. These results suggest that GMP may protect against NSAID enteropathy through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.	10.3390/molecules25102351

The immunomodulatory effect of GMP and its derivates on the cell proliferative response of human macrophagelike cell, U937, and its effect on phagocytic activities via incorporation of fluorescence beads were studied. GMP was found to be a potent immunoenhancer at low concentrations, significantly enhancing the proliferation and phagocytic activities of U937. The modulatory function could be radically altered by enzymatic treatments. Pepsin digestion significantly enhanced the degree of cell proliferation and phagocytic activities, whereas trypsin had no significant effect. The immunoenhancing effects decreased significantly after sialidase treatment; however, more than 70% of activity was retained after treatment. GMP with different carbohydrate chains was shown to possess different modulatory capabilities. Sialic acid-rich GMP fractions showed an enhanced response. These findings indicate that both the carbohydrate chains compositions, including the terminal sialic acids and the polypeptide portions of GMP, are essential for the stimulatory effects of GMP on cell proliferation and phagocytic activities of U937.	10.1021/jf0355102

The effect of caseinomacropeptide (CMP) (the [106–169] fragment of κ-casein produced during digestion of milk protein), was studied in anesthetized rats using bile diversion for a pure pancreatic juice collection system. Intraduodenal administration of CMP induced a dose-related specific stimulation of pancreatic secretion which was nearly abolished by devazepide, atropine, hexamethonium, vagotomy or perivagal capsaicin pretreatment. Moreover, CMP did not inhibit in vitro trypsin activity. These results demonstrate that CMP is more likely to stimulate pancreatic secretion specifically through cholecystokinin release and activation of a vago-vagal cholinergic reflex loop than by inhibition of luminal trypsin, in anesthetized rats.	10.1016/s0196-9781(00)00307-7

The maintenance of a healthy skin barrier is crucial to prevent and treat atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions and avoid infections. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a bioactive peptide that has demonstrated promising results as an anti-inflammatory and antipruritic therapy for experimental AD. This study aimed to analyze the effect of GMP on impaired cutaneous barrier-related signs in a rat model of AD lesions. AD-like dermatitis was induced on the skin by repeated topical applications of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and animals were orally administered GMP before or after AD induction. The expression of skin structural proteins and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was evaluated by immunoblot or immunohistochemistry, epidermal thickening was evaluated by histochemistry, the level of IFN-γ and changes in the microbiota were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the quantity of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was evaluated by gas chromatography. GMP administration significantly increased filaggrin, β-defensin 2, and cathelicidin-related AMP expression in AD-like lesions. Involucrin expression was not modified. In GMP-treated animals, epidermal thickening and IFN-γ expression were strongly reduced in damaged skin. GMP treatment impacted the skin microbiota and prevented Staphylococcus aureus colonization, which is associated with AD. In addition, high levels of Bifidobacterium were detected in the feces of GMP-treated animals, and the acetic acid and butyric acid contents increased in animals prophylactically administered GMP. These results suggest that GMP markedly prevents or reverses skin barrier damage in rat AD-like lesions through a bifidogenic effect that induces fecal SCFA production with prolonged treatment. Our findings provide evidence that GMP may represent an optimum strategy for the therapy of the dysfunctional cutaneous barrier in AD.	10.1089/jmf.2019.0247

Milk was fermented for up to 5 h at 43 °C with two lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus). A protease, flavourzyme, was added at the beginning of fermentation. The whey fraction was separated from the fermented milk and freeze-dried. During the 5 h of fermentation, the soluble protein content increased from 4.9 to 57.4 mg/g and peptide content increased from 2.1 to 32.8 mg/g, while inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) increased by a decrease of IC50 from 0.708 to 0.266 mg/ml, respectively. The whey was fractionated into four fractions by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 column. The fourth fraction of the whey showed the highest inhibitory efficiency ratio (IER) being 1329%/mg/ml. The amino acid sequence of the inhibitory peptide was Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, of which the IC50 was 90.9 μM. The whey showed mixed-type inhibition kinetics, while Captopril, the positive control showed competitive inhibition on ACE. Their Ki values were 0.188 mg/ml and 0.0067 μg/ml, respectively. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was reduced to 15.9 and 15.6 mm Hg, respectively, in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), after 8 weeks of oral administration of diluted whey (peptide concentration 4.9 mg/ml).	10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.06.039

In silico digestion of milk protein-derived peptides with gastrointestinal enzyme activities was used to predict the release of peptides with a Pro residue at position 2 from the N terminus. These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.097

Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine κ-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to κ-casein (25–34). Casoxin C was active at 5 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine κ-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.	10.1017/s0022029900028818

YPSYGLN	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	56-62	Opioid						Biologically active peptides in milk proteins	Meisel, H. et al.	Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.	10.1007/BF02019390
YIPIQYVLSR	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	46-55	Immunomodulatory	C3a Receptors agonist					Identification of Casoxin C, An Ileum-contracting Peptide Derived From Bovine kappa-casein, as an Agonist for C3a Receptors	Takahashi, M. et al.	Takahashi, M., S. Moriguchi, H. Suganuma, A. Shiota, F. Tani, H. Usui, K. Kurahashi, R. Sasaki and M. Yoshikawa. Identification of casoxin C, an ileum-contracting peptide derived from bovine κ-casein, as an agonist for C3a receptors. Peptides 18(3) 329-336, 1997.—Casoxin C (Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg) is a bioactive peptide that was isolated from a tryptic digest of bovine κ-casein as an anti-opioid peptide in longitudinal strips of guinea pig ileum. Casoxin C also evokes contraction of the ileal strips, and we found that this process was biphasic with rapid and slow components. The contractile profile was very similar to that of human complement C3a(70-77), which is the COOH-terminal octapeptide of C3a and has, although less potent, qualitatively the same biological activities as C3a. Casoxin C also has homology with C3a(70-77). The rapid contraction was mediated by histamine release and the slow contraction was mediated by a prostaglandin E2-like substance, judging from the effects of various pharmacological inhibitors and antagonists on the ileal contraction. Casoxin C had affinity for C3a receptors (IC50 = 40 μM) in the radioreceptor assay. In addition, casoxin C showed phagocyte-stimulating activities. Casoxin C is therefore the first milk-derived peptide identified, that acts through complement C3a receptors.	10.1016/s0196-9781(97)00044-2
YIPIQYVLSR	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	46-55	Opioid	Opioid antagonist					Opioid antagonist peptides derived from kappa-casein	Chiba, H. et al.	Opioid antagonists were sought in the fragments of κ-casein which were obtained by chemical synthesis and enzymic digestion. A synthetic bovine κ-casein peptide (35–41), Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Asn (casoxin A) showed opioid antagonist activity at 200 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. A synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr (casoxin B) which is found in bovine and human κ-casein, also showed opioid antagonist activity at 100 μM. Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine κ-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to κ-casein (25–34). Casoxin C was active at 5 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine κ-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.	10.1017/s0022029900028818
YIPIQYVLSR	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	46-55	Opioid						Contents of agonistic and antagonistic opioid peptides in different cheese varieties	Sienkiewicz-Szłapka, E. et al.	Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011

We have found various bioactive peptides derived from animal and plant proteins, which interact with receptors for endogenous bioactive peptides such as opioids, neurotensin, complements C3a and C5a, oxytocin, and formyl peptides etc. Among them, rubiscolin, a δ opioid peptide derived from plant RuBisCO, showed memory-consolidating, anxiolytic-like, and food intake-modulating effects. Soymorphin, a μ opioid peptide derived from β-conglycinin showed anxiolytic-like, anorexigenic, hypoglycemic, and hypotriglyceridemic effects. β-Lactotensin derived from β-lactoglobulin, the first natural ligand for the NTS2 receptor, showed memory-consolidating, anxiolytic-like, and hypocholesterolemic effects. Weak agonist peptides for the complements C3a and C5a receptors were released from many proteins and exerted various central effects. Peptides showing anxiolytic-like antihypertensive and anti-alopecia effects via different types of receptors such as OT, FPR and AT2 were also obtained. Based on these study, new functions and post-receptor mechanisms of receptor commom to endogenous and exogenous bioactive peptides have been clarified.	10.1016/j.peptides.2015.07.013
YPY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	79-81	DPP-IV Inhibitory		243.7				Susceptibility of milk protein-derived peptides to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) hydrolysis	Nongonierma, A. et al.	In silico digestion of milk protein-derived peptides with gastrointestinal enzyme activities was used to predict the release of peptides with a Pro residue at position 2 from the N terminus. These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.097
LPYPY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	77-81	ACE-inhibitory		12.87				Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from Lactobacillus delbrueckii QS306 fermented milk	Wu, N. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified from milk fermented using Lactobacillus delbrueckii QS306. The peptide with the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity (C5) was purified using ultrafiltration with 10 and 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off membranes, Sephadex G-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) gel filtration chromatography, reversed-phase HPLC, and Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We obtained peptide LPYPY by microbial fermentation, which was derived from κ-casein f (AA 77–81). We synthesized LPYPY using an Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method and explored the secondary structure of the pentapeptide. The half maximal inhibitory concentration for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of LPYPY was 12.87 μg/mL. The results provide additional information for ongoing research and the development of functional foods having antihypertensive effects.	10.3168/jds.2018-15901
LPYPY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	77-81	ACE-inhibitory		28.9				Identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides from ovine milk proteins by CE-MS and chromatographic techniques	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.	10.1002/elps.200700324
LPYPY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	77-81	DPP-IV Inhibitory						Investigation into the bioavailability of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitory activity using Caco-2 cell monolayers	Lacroix, IME. et al.	In recent years, peptides derived from a variety of dietary proteins have been reported to exhibit inhibitory activity against the dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme, a target in the management of type 2 diabetes. While much attention has been given to the production and identification of peptides with DPP-IV inhibitory activity from food proteins, particularly dairy proteins, little is known on the bioavailability of these molecules. In this study, the stability and transport of five previously identified milk-derived peptides (LKPTPEGDL, LPYPY, IPIQY, IPI and WR) and a whey protein isolate (WPI) digest with DPP-IV-inhibitory activity were investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayers as a model system for human intestinal absorption. Even though a small percentage (ranging from 0.05% for LPYPY to 0.47% for WR) of the bioactive peptides added to the apical side was able to cross the monolayer intact, all five peptides investigated were susceptible to peptidase action during the transport study. Conversely, only minor changes to the WPI digest composition were observed. Determination of the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the peptides and amino acids identified in the apical and basolateral solutions showed that most degradation products were less effective at inhibiting DPP-IV than the peptide they originated from. Findings from this research suggest that the susceptibility of food-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides to degradation by intestinal brush border membrane enzymes may alter their biological activity in vivo. Further research should be conducted to enhance the bioavailability of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides.	10.1039/c6fo01411a

IPI	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	47-49	DPP-IV Inhibitory		3.5				Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) by proline containing casein-derived peptides	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Dipeptides with a C terminal Pro inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a key enzyme in incretin hormone processing. It was hypothesised that tri- and tetrapeptides with a proline at the C-terminus may also be DPP-IV inhibitors. Therefore, an in silico hydrolysis approach was used to release short (4 ⩽ amino acids) C terminal Pro peptides from the individual caseins which constitute Pro rich substrates. This was achieved using theoretical digestion of caseins with a prolyl oligopeptidase activity. Fifteen peptides were subsequently selected for in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory analysis. Stability of these peptides to gastrointestinal enzymes was also evaluated in silico and the predicted breakdown peptides were assessed for their DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential. New DPP-IV inhibitors were identified, the most potent being Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (IC50 65.3 ± 3.5 μM). A low in vitro antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging) activity was also associated with the peptides studied. The strategy presented highlights the utility of employing an in silico approach for the prediction of food-derived peptides with a potential role in glycaemic management for subsequent development of functional foods.	10.1016/j.jff.2013.09.012

IPI	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	47-49	DPP-IV Inhibitory		4.9				Selective enrichment of bioactive properties during ultrafiltration of a tryptic digest of β-lactoglobulin	Power, O. et al.	Whey proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides which may play a role in the dietary management of chronic diseases. Fractionation via ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the enrichment of antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg TH). UF processing selectively enhanced the biofunctional properties of β-Lg TH with the permeate obtained using a 1 kDa polyethersulfone (HFP-1) membrane having highest in vitro multifunctional bioactivity. Compared to β-Lg TH, the antioxidant activity was 1.7-fold higher (46,765 ± 2504 vs. 77,251 ± 5124 µmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dw; P < 0.05), DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased threefold (1.6 ± 0.31 vs. 0.53 ± 0.05 mg/mL; P < 0.05) and there was a twofold reduction in ACE IC50 (0.131 ± 0.005 vs. 0.068 ± 0.018 mg/mL; P < 0.05). The multifunctional peptide VAGTWY, β-Lg f(15–20) was shown to have potent antioxidant activity (5.63 µmol TE/µmol peptide). Two new ACE inhibitory peptides, IIAEK and IPAVFK, having IC50 values of 63.7 ± 7.22 and 144.8 ± 25.3 μM, respectively, were also identified in β-Lg TH. This study demonstrates the multifunctional bioactive properties of a β-Lg TH and its associated UF fractions.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.04.002
INNQFLPYPY	P02670	Kappa-casein	Capra hircus	72-81	DPP-IV Inhibitory		40.08				Isolation and Identification of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV-Inhibitory Peptides from Trypsin/Chymotrypsin-Treated Goat Milk Casein Hydrolysates by 2D-TLC and LC-MS/MS	Zhang, Y. et al.	New dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-inhibitory peptides from trypsin/chymotrypsin-treated goat milk casein hydrolysates were isolated and identified by two-dimensional silica thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) combined to nano LC–MS/MS. 2D-TLC with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (2:2:1) and n-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1) as the first- and second-dimension eluents, respectively, in analytical and semipreparative scales, was set up and verified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP–HPLC) to be feasible and efficient to separate the hydrolysates. Five new DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, four relatively large oligopeptides (MHQPPQPL, SPTVMFPPQSVL, VMFPPQSVL, and INNQFLPYPY), and AWPQYL were identified, and INNQFLPYPY showed a notable IC50 value of 40.08 μM as an uncompetitive inhibitor. Interactive effects on DPP-IV inhibition were also observed among separated fractions and pure synthetic peptide mixtures with concentration-dependent activity. The study gives new insights into goat casein hydrolysates with identified DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides efficiently isolated by 2D-TLC, which provides a simple and cost-efficient separation process and is compatible with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) identification.	10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03062
MAIPPKK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	127-133	ACE-inhibitory						Vascular effects and antihypertensive properties of kappa-casein macropeptide	Miguel, M. et al.	The blood-pressure-lowering effect of bovine κ-casein macropeptide (CMP), previously reported to exhibit a modest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro, was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The oral administration of CMP (150 mg kg−1) significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR. The antihypertensive action was more pronounced when CMP was treated with trypsin. The sequence MAIPPKK, identified in the tryptic hydrolysate of bovine CMP, significantly reduced blood pressure at a dose of 10 mg kg−1. The CMP and its tryptic peptides induced relaxation of endothelium-intact aortic rings. The sequence MAIPPKK also evoked a significant relaxation effect; however, the shorter sequence MAIPPK and the strong ACE-inhibitory tripeptide IPP exhibited a vascular relaxing effect lower than 10%. The implications of vascular relaxing mechanisms, as well as the possibility that the tripeptide IPP is at least partially responsible for the antihypertensive effects of CMP, are discussed.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.009
MAIPPKK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	127-133	Antithrombotic						Bioactive peptides released by in vitro digestion of standard and hydrolyzed infant formulas	Wada, Y. et al.	Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides. Infants fed hydrolyzed infant formulas may be influenced by milk protein-derived bioactive peptides in a manner different from those fed standard formula.	10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.005
YVL	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	51-53	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	S. maracescens L. innocua S. carnosus		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 
YVL	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	51-53	Antioxidant						Casein hydrolysates as a source of antimicrobial, antioxidant and antihypertensive peptides	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	 The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences. 	10.1051/lait:2007019
VPNSYP	P07498	Kappa-casein	Homo sapiens	51-56	Antioxidant						Novel anti-oxidative peptides from enzymatic digestion of human milk	Tsopmo, A. et al.	Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146
NPYVPR	P07498	Kappa-casein	Homo sapiens	73-78	Antioxidant						Milk-derived bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant activity through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway	Tonolo, F. et al.	Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696
NPYVPR	P07498	Kappa-casein	Homo sapiens	73-78	Antioxidant						Novel anti-oxidative peptides from enzymatic digestion of human milk	Tsopmo, A. et al.	Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146
IQY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	49-51	ACE-inhibitory		70.4				Casein hydrolysates as a source of antimicrobial, antioxidant and antihypertensive peptides	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	 The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences. 	10.1051/lait:2007019
IQY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	49-51	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf) 	E. coli		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992

A strategy was established for the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides from human milk. For the generation of bioactive peptides human milk was acidified and proteolyzed with pepsin simulating the digest in infants stomachs. Separation of proteins and resulting fragments was performed by means of reversed-phase chromatography detecting the antimicrobial activity of each fraction using a sensitive radial diffusion assay. In order to avoid the purification of the known abundant antimicrobial milk protein lysozyme, it was identified in HPLC fractions by its enzymatic activity and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–mass spectrometry (MALDI–MS). On condition that lysozyme was not detectable and antibacterial activity of HPLC fractions was caused by a peptide, which was confirmed by proteolytic cleavage leading to a loss of activity, further purification was performed by consecutive chromatographic steps guided by the antibacterial assay. Using this strategy, an as yet unknown casein fragment exhibiting antimicrobial activity was purified in addition to antimicrobial lactoferrin fragments. The new antimicrobial peptide resembles a proteolytic fragment of human casein-κ (residues 63–117) and inhibits the growth of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. Our results confirm that antimicrobially-active peptides are liberated from human milk proteins during proteolytic hydrolysis and may play an important role in the host defense system of the newborn.	10.1016/s0378-4347(00)00516-8

TEAVESTVATL	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	157-167	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli B. subtilis		Identification of novel antibacterial peptides isolated from a commercially available casein hydrolysate by autofocusing technique	Elbarbary, H. et al.	Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	10.1002/biof.1023

PTVHSTPTTE	P02670	Kappa-casein	Capra hircus	151-160	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli B. cereus L. monocytogenes		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085

MMK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus		Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus L. casei L. acidophilus		Plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides	Sedaghati, M. et al.	This study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine κ-casein and the fractions (named κC1, κC2, κC3, κC4, and κC5) liberated from it using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). Three peptides (kC1, kC3, and kC4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with κC3 peptide being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine κ-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. The three antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular mass of kC1, kC3, and kC4 corresponded to the f(17–21), f(22–24), and f(1–3) of bovine κ-casein, respectively. It was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of κ-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1017/S0022029914000120
MAIPPKKNQDKTEIPTINT	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	127-145	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli		Effect of pepsin-treated bovine and goat caseinomacropeptide on Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus in acidic conditions	Robitaille, G. et al.	Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a 7-kDa phosphoglycopolypeptide released from κ-casein during milk digestion and in the cheesemaking process. The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of pepsin-treated CMP from cow and goat milk on the resistance of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus during acid stress. Bacterial cells in the exponential growth phase were suspended in acidified phosphate buffered saline with or without pepsin-treated CMP. Viability was determined during a 90-min incubation period. Pepsin-treated CMP exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 3.5 when added in a dose-dependent manner to E. coli, decreasing survival by more than 90% within 15 min at 0.25 mg/mL. At pH >4.5, the bactericidal activity disappeared, indicating that pepsin-treated CMP was efficient at low pH only. The effectiveness of pepsin-treated CMP at pH 3.5 was not affected by the presence of glycoconjugates linked to CMP or by the bovine or caprine origin of milk. In contrast, L. rhamnosus, a probiotic, was more resistant to acid stress when pepsin-treated bovine or caprine CMP was added to the media. Viability reached 50% after 60 min of incubation at pH 3 compared with 5% survival in the media without added pepsin-treated CMP. Neither glycosylation extent nor sequence variations between CMP from bovine milk and caprine milk affected the protective activity of hydrolyzed CMP toward L. rhamnosus. This suggests that encrypted bioactive peptides released by the pepsin treatment of CMP had an antibacterial effect on E. coli in acidic media, but improved the resistance of L. rhamnosus to acid stress. The peptide fragment accountable for bactericidal activity is the N-terminal region κ-casein f(106-124).	10.3168/jds.2010-4142

IAK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	43-45	ACE-inhibitory		15.7				Identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides from ovine milk proteins by CE-MS and chromatographic techniques	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.	10.1002/elps.200700324

In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals. SBP and DBP returned to baseline values 24 h post-administration of all peptides. In conclusion, these peptides are bioactive ingredients with potential benefit in the prevention and treatment of hypertension or other associated disorders.	10.1002/mnfr.200900448
IAK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	43-45	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus L. casei L. acidophilus		Plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides	Sedaghati, M. et al.	This study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine κ-casein and the fractions (named κC1, κC2, κC3, κC4, and κC5) liberated from it using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). Three peptides (kC1, kC3, and kC4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with κC3 peptide being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine κ-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. The three antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular mass of kC1, kC3, and kC4 corresponded to the f(17–21), f(22–24), and f(1–3) of bovine κ-casein, respectively. It was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of κ-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1017/S0022029914000120
FSDKIAK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	39-45	ACE-inhibitory		113.6				Casein hydrolysates as a source of antimicrobial, antioxidant and antihypertensive peptides	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	 The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences. 	10.1051/lait:2007019
FSDKIAK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	39-45	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	E. coli L. innocua S. carnosus		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 
FFSDK	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	38-42	Anticancer	Cytotoxic for leukemic cells					Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of chemically synthesized kappa-casecidin and its partial peptide fragments	Matin, A. et al.	Milk is known to provide not only excellent nutrition but also protection against infection in mammalian neonates. Whey proteins, such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lysozyme and lactoperoxidase, are well known antimicrobial components in milk. Håkansson et al. (1995) demonstrated that some multimeric human α-lactalbumin derivatives induced apoptosis in immature and tumour cells. Yoo et al. (1997) found that lactoferricin, which had been isolated from peptic lactoferrin as an antimicrobial peptide, induced apoptosis in tumour and immature mammalian cells. Apoptotic cell death is considered to be an important physiological function in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms and to be a highly controlled means of eliminating dangerous, damaged or unnecessary cells without causing tissue damage. Therefore, these findings suggest that whey proteins may have beneficial health effects by restricting specific cell population in the body.	10.1017/s0022029902005435

AVESTVATLEDSPEVIESPPE	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	159-179	Antimicrobial			MIC	S. mutans		Kappacin, a Novel Antibacterial Peptide from Bovine Milk	Malkoski, M. et al.	Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a heterogeneous C-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk κ-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. We have demonstrated that CMP has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens Streptococcus mutans andPorphyromonas gingivalis and against Escherichia coli. CMP was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and each fraction was tested for activity against S. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. Fractions were characterized by N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. The active form of CMP was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated κ-casein (residues 106 to 169) [κ-casein(106–169)], which we have designated kappacin. Endoproteinase Glu-C was used to hydrolyze CMP, and the generated peptides were separated using RP-HPLC and gel filtration-HPLC and then tested for activity against S. mutans. The peptide Ser(P)149κ-casein-A(138–158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase Glu-C digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide Ser(P)149κ-casein-A(138–158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart κ-casein-A(138–158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. The synthetic Ser(P)149 κ-casein-A(138–158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against S. mutans(MIC, 59 μg/ml [26 μM]). The nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.	10.1128/AAC.45.8.2309-2315.2001
ASAEPTVH	P02670	Kappa-casein	Capra hircus	147-154	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli B. cereus L. monocytogenes		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085
YQQRPVA	P02669	Kappa-casein	Ovis aries	64-70	ACE-inhibitory		14.3				Identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides from ovine milk proteins by CE-MS and chromatographic techniques	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.	10.1002/elps.200700324

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621

In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner.

VLSRYP	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	52-57	ACE-inhibitory		36.7				Purification and identification of novel peptides with inhibitory effect against angiotensin I-converting enzyme and optimization of process conditions in milk fermented with the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus	Li, Y. et al.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from milk fermented with the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus Z17 were identified. The optimum process conditions for the production of bioactive peptides were also established. Two novel peptides exhibiting ACE-inhibitory activity were identified from the fermented milk using Sephadex G-15 gel filtration, reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography and MALDI/TOF-TOF MS/MS. The sequences of the two novel peptides were VLSRYP and LRFF with IC50 values of 36.7 and 116.9 µM, respectively. Lineweaver–Burk plots revealed that both peptides behaved as competitive ACE inhibitors. Response surface methodology was used to determine the optimum process conditions for the production of ACE-inhibitory peptides. The results showed that the most significant factors affecting ACE inhibition were fermentation temperature, inoculum level and rotation speed. The maximum ACE-inhibitory activity (81.23%) was observed at temperature 32 °C, initial pH 6.5, inoculum level 6% and rotation speed of 189 rpm. The peptide content and peptidase activity (carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase) had a significant positive effect on ACE inhibition, while endoproteinase activity showed an insignificant effect. The results of this study may contribute to the development of a functional beverage with antihypertensive effects.	10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.043

SY	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	58-59	ACE-inhibitory		41.0				Characterization of New Milk-derived Inhibitors of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme In Vitro and In Vivo	Fuglsang, A. et al.	inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been observed with a variety of different peptides, and peptide fragments with inhibitory capabilities have been identified within many different proteins, including milk proteins. The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.	10.1080/1475636031000138723

Novel angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides were isolated from bovine casein hydrolysate prepared by AS1.398 neutral protease. The active hydrolysate obtained at 12 h hydrolysis showed the highest ACE-inhibitory activity and was further consecutively separated by ultrafiltration, and the 3 kDa permeate showed the highest ACE-inhibiting activity. This active fraction was further purified to yield two novel ACE-inhibiting peptides, whose amino acid sequences were Arg-Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly (κ-casein; f25–30) and Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (κ-casein; f15–18), respectively. The IC50 value of the peptides were 54 ± 1.2 μg/mL and 21 ± 0.8 μg/mL, respectively. The Lineweaver–Burk plots revealed that the peptides acts as a non-competitive inhibitor. Antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats also revealed that single and repeated oral administrations of hydrolysates of bovine casein decreased systolic blood pressure significantly in spontaneously hypertensive rats (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). These results suggested that the peptide derived from peptides from bovine casein would be a beneficial ingredient for functional food or pharmaceuticals against hypertension.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.026

A total of 75 peptides included in the fraction with molecular mass below 3000 from an 8-month-old Manchego cheese could be identified using HPLC coupled on line to an ion trap mass spectrometer. Some previously described peptides with antihypertensive and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were detected. The formation of five active sequences was followed during cheese ripening in four different batches of Manchego cheese. Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.	10.1016/j.chroma.2004.05.022

It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621

Yak (Bos grunniens) milk casein derived from Qula, a kind of acid curd cheese from northwestern China, was hydrolysed with alcalase. The hydrolysates collected at different hydrolysis times (0 min, 60 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 300 min, 360 min) were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE), and the one obtained at 240 min hydrolysis showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity. The active hydrolysate was further consecutively separated by ultrafiltration with 10 kDa and then with 6 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes into different parts, and the 6 kDa permeate showed the highest ACE-inhibiting activity. This active fraction was further purified to yield two novel ACE-inhibiting peptides, whose amino acid sequences were Pro–Pro–Glu–Ile–Asn (PPEIN)(κ-CN; f156–160) and Pro–Leu–Pro–Leu–Leu (PLPLL) (β-CN; f136–140), respectively. The molecular weight and IC50 value of the peptides were 550 Da and 566.4 Da, and 0.29 ± 0.01 mg/ml and 0.25 ± 0.01 mg/ml, respectively.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.10.041

In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.	10.1002/elps.200700324

In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals. SBP and DBP returned to baseline values 24 h post-administration of all peptides. In conclusion, these peptides are bioactive ingredients with potential benefit in the prevention and treatment of hypertension or other associated disorders.	10.1002/mnfr.200900448 
HPHPHLSF	P02669	Kappa-casein	Ovis aries	119-126	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2

Novel angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides were isolated from bovine casein hydrolysate prepared by AS1.398 neutral protease. The active hydrolysate obtained at 12 h hydrolysis showed the highest ACE-inhibitory activity and was further consecutively separated by ultrafiltration, and the 3 kDa permeate showed the highest ACE-inhibiting activity. This active fraction was further purified to yield two novel ACE-inhibiting peptides, whose amino acid sequences were Arg-Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly (κ-casein; f25–30) and Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (κ-casein; f15–18), respectively. The IC50 value of the peptides were 54 ± 1.2 μg/mL and 21 ± 0.8 μg/mL, respectively. The Lineweaver–Burk plots revealed that the peptides acts as a non-competitive inhibitor. Antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats also revealed that single and repeated oral administrations of hydrolysates of bovine casein decreased systolic blood pressure significantly in spontaneously hypertensive rats (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). These results suggested that the peptide derived from peptides from bovine casein would be a beneficial ingredient for functional food or pharmaceuticals against hypertension.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.026

In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009

YG	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	59-60	Immunomodulatory	Stimulated lymphocyte proliferation					Stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by bioactive peptides derived from bovine milk proteins	Kayser, H. et al.	The in vitro modulation of the proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes of different synthetic peptides derived from milk proteins was investigated. Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.	10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4

Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress.

In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117

IPPKKNQDKTE	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	129-139	Ameliorates insulin resistance						Peptide IPPKKNQDKTE ameliorates insulin resistance in HepG2 cells via blocking ROS-mediated MAPK signaling	Song, J. et al.	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been found to play an important role in insulin resistance. Whether the improvement effects of the peptide IPPKKNQDKTE on hepatic insulin resistance were mediated by ROS elimination was examined in this study. Results showed that the high glucose-induced MAPK signaling activation was inhibited by IPPKKNQDKTE in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, which contributed to the improvement of IPPKKNQDKTE on cellular glucose uptake and the phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Ser636/639 and Ser307. IPPKKNQDKTE dose-dependently reduced high glucose-induced ROS production, which involved in suppression of IPPKKNQDKTE on MAPK signaling in high glucose-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Moreover, IPPKKNQDKTE increased Nrf2 nucleus translocation and induced HO-1 expression. HO-1 inhibitor partly reversed IPPKKNQDKTE-mediated suppression on high glucose-induced ROS production. Taken together, IPPKKNQDKTE reduced high glucose-induced ROS production and MAPK activation by the activation of Nrf2/HO-1, which contributed to increase the glucose uptake and decrease the Ser phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. These results indicated that IPPKKNQDKTE plays a potential role in the management of hepatic insulin resistance.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.02.005
ARHPHPHLSFM	P02668	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	117-127	Antioxidant						Milk-derived bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant activity through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway	Tonolo, F. et al.	Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696

Oncological diseases are one of the main causes of death of adult population. Study of the mechanisms of occurrence of malignant neoplasms and the search for pathways of suppression of their growth are among the most topical problems of modern molecular biology. The molecular mechanisms of cancer development and the ways of their regulation and control are actively studied. Special attention is given to studies of the mechanisms of apoptosis, whose disturbance is one of the causes of malignant transformation of normal cells. The possibility to induce apoptosis of malignant cells by tumor cell-specific protein factors underlies designing a number of modern anticancer drugs. Today, several proteins of this type are used for human cancer therapy in clinical practice. These preparations are primarily derived from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and its analogues. However, preparations based on antiinflammatory cytokines are cause adverse side effects that limit their use and stimulate the search for new proteins that can induce apoptosis of cancer cells. For this reason, the search for and identification of proteins that can selectively inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of cancer cells and study of the mechanism of their action are among the key problems of molecular biology and biochemistry. In this study, we describe isolation of a new protein from human milk that induces apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells.	10.1134/s1607672908020038

Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion.

Selected synthetic dipeptides and milk protein hydrolysates were evaluated for their dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory properties, and their superoxide (SO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities. DPP-IV inhibition was seen with eight out of the twelve dipeptides and 5 of the twelve hydrolysates studied. Trp-Val inhibited DPP-IV, however, inhibition was not observed with the reverse peptide Val-Trp. The most potent hydrolysate inhibitors were generated from casein (CasH2) and lactoferrin (LFH1). Two Trp containing dipeptides, Trp-Val and Val-Trp, and three lactoferrin hydrolysates scavenged DPPH. The dipeptides had higher SO EC(50) values compared to the milk protein hydrolysates (arising from three lactoferrin and one whey protein hydrolysates). Higher molecular mass fractions of the milk protein hydrolysates were associated with the SO scavenging activity. Trp-Val and one lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH1) were multifunctional displaying both DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant (SO and DPPH scavenging) activities. These compounds may have potential as dietary ingredients in the management of type 2 diabetes by virtue of their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and to extend the half-life of incretin molecules.	10.1016/j.peptides.2012.11.016

Short peptides in food protein hydrolysates are of significant interest as they may be highly bioactive whilst also being bioavailable. A dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) was fractionated using nanofiltration (NF) with a 200 Da MWCO membrane. The DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration of the NF permeate (IC50 = 0.66 ± 0.08 mg protein equivalent mL− 1) was significantly more potent (P > 0.05) than that of the starting WPH (IC50 = 0.94 ± 0.24 mg protein equivalent mL− 1) and associated retentate (IC50 = 0.82 ± 0.13 mg protein equivalent mL− 1). This confirmed the contribution of short peptides within the NF permeate to the overall DPP-IV inhibitory activity. An hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC-) and reverse-phase (RP-) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) strategy, based on two retention time models, allowed detection of eight free amino acids and eight di- to tetrapeptides in the NF permeate. The potential sequences of the peptides within the NF permeate were then ranked on the basis of their highest probability of occurrence. A confirmatory study with synthetic peptides showed that valine–alanine (VA), valine–leucine (VL), tryptophan–leucine (WL) and tryptophan–isoleucine (WI) displayed DPP-IV IC50 values < 170 μM. The NF and LC–MS strategies employed herein represent a new approach for the targeted identification of short peptides within bioactive food protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.foodres.2015.09.012

The cell growth-stimulating activity of lactoferrin (LF) in combination with epidermal growth factor (EGF) was evaluated by using a rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-18. LF was found to be more effective than EGF for inducing an increase in cell numbers when cultured for over 6 days using a medium containing 0.2% fetal calf serum (FCS), although the 3H-thymidine incorporation-stimulating activity of EGF was more potent than that of LF. A synergistic effect of LF and EGF was observed in both cell proliferation and DNA synthesis assays. The increase in cell numbers when stimulated with LF plus EGF corresponded to about 5 times that of the control. Iron was not required for manifestation of these effects of LF. On the other hand, iron-saturated transferrin (TF) had cell-growth-stimulating activity, but iron-free TF did not, either in the presence or absence of EGF. These results indicate that LF induces cell proliferation by a mechanism distinct from that of TF. A pepsin-generated hydrolysate of LF (LFH) had an activity similar to that of undigested LF, and a peptide with cell-growth-stimulating activity from bovine LFH was isolated by monitoring its effects in combination with EGF on DNA synthesis in IEC-18 cells. Sequence analysis indicated that the peptide has the structure Ala-Glu-Ile-Tyr-Gly-Thr-Lys-Glu-Ser-Pro-Gln-Thr-His-TyrTyr, corresponding to residues 79–93 of bovine LF.	10.1271/bbb.59.1875

Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011

Opioid antagonists were sought in the fragments of κ-casein which were obtained by chemical synthesis and enzymic digestion. A synthetic bovine κ-casein peptide (35–41), Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Asn (casoxin A) showed opioid antagonist activity at 200 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. A synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr (casoxin B) which is found in bovine and human κ-casein, also showed opioid antagonist activity at 100 μM. Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine κ-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to κ-casein (25–34). Casoxin C was active at 5 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine κ-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.	10.1017/s0022029900028818

Peptides with affinity for opioid receptors were found in an artificially methyl-esterified peptic digest of human lactoferrin. Three active peptides were purified by two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their structures were Tyr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Gly-Tyr-OCH3, Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-OCH2, and Lys-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Tyr-OCH3, which respectively correspond to the methyl esters of residues 318-323, 536-540, and 673-679 of human lactoferrin. The IC50 values of these peptides were 15, 10 and 23 microM, respectively, in a radioreceptor assay in the presence of 1 nM [3H]naloxone. In the myenteric plexus preparation of the longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum, the individual peptides had no opioid agonist activities, but they antagonized [Met5]enkephalin and morphiceptin when they were at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-5) M, suggesting that these were the opioid antagonist peptides. These three opioid antagonist peptides were named lactoferroxin A, B and C, after casoxin, the opioid antagonist peptide derived from bovine kappa-casein. Concerning the antagonist activities of lactoferroxins for opioid receptor sub-types, lactoferroxin A showed preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C had somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors. A study of the structure-activity relationship of the three lactoferroxins and their synthetic analogues showed that these opioid antagonist peptides derived from food protein could be expressed by the general formula XA-Tyr-XB-Tyr-OCH3. An amino acid in position XA may affect the specificity of the antagonist peptide for opioid receptor sub-types.	10.1080/00021369.1990.10870214
KYLGPQY	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	680-686	Opioid	Opioid antagonist					Isolation and Characterization of Opioid Antagonist Peptides Derived from Human Lactoferrin	Tani, F. et al.	Peptides with affinity for opioid receptors were found in an artificially methyl-esterified peptic digest of human lactoferrin. Three active peptides were purified by two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their structures were Tyr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Gly-Tyr-OCH3, Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-OCH2, and Lys-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Tyr-OCH3, which respectively correspond to the methyl esters of residues 318-323, 536-540, and 673-679 of human lactoferrin. The IC50 values of these peptides were 15, 10 and 23 microM, respectively, in a radioreceptor assay in the presence of 1 nM [3H]naloxone. In the myenteric plexus preparation of the longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum, the individual peptides had no opioid agonist activities, but they antagonized [Met5]enkephalin and morphiceptin when they were at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-5) M, suggesting that these were the opioid antagonist peptides. These three opioid antagonist peptides were named lactoferroxin A, B and C, after casoxin, the opioid antagonist peptide derived from bovine kappa-casein. Concerning the antagonist activities of lactoferroxins for opioid receptor sub-types, lactoferroxin A showed preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C had somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors. A study of the structure-activity relationship of the three lactoferroxins and their synthetic analogues showed that these opioid antagonist peptides derived from food protein could be expressed by the general formula XA-Tyr-XB-Tyr-OCH3. An amino acid in position XA may affect the specificity of the antagonist peptide for opioid receptor sub-types.	10.1080/00021369.1990.10870214
YP	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	185-186	ACE-inhibitory						Characterization of casein-derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976
YP	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	185-186	ACE-inhibitory		720.0				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
YP	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	185-186	ACE-inhibitory		720.0				Purification and Characterization of an Antihypertensive Peptide from a Yogurt-Like Product Fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CPN4	Yamamoto, N. et al.	Whey peptides in a yogurt-like product fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CPN4 were fractionated by a Sep-pak C-18 cartridge followed by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. The antihypertensive activity was measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration of each fraction. Five major peptides in the final fraction were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC and were measured for these antihypertensive activities in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The only peptide in the final fraction that showed strong antihypertensive activity had a sequence of Tyr-Pro, which is found in alpha s1-casein (CN), beta-CN, and kappa-CN. The synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro yielded significant antihypertensive activity from 2 to 8 h after oral administration of 1 mg of peptide/kg of body weight, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration. The antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the peptide dosage from 0.1 to 10 mg of peptide/kg of body weight. The concentration of Tyr-Pro peptide increased during fermentation and reached about 8.1 micrograms/ml of whey in the pH 4.3 yogurt-like product. The antihypertensive peptide had a low inhibitory activity against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The inhibition of 50% of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (IC50) was 720 microM.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(99)75364-6
YP	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	185-186	Antihypertensive						Production of an antihypertensive peptide from milk by the brown rot fungus Neolentinus lepideus	Okamoto, K. et al.	Fermented milk has been shown to have beneficial effects on human health exerted through its bioactive peptides. The lactose-fermenting brown rot fungus Neolentinus lepideus has been shown to ferment milk; however, its ability to produce bioactive peptides has not been explored. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the ability N. lepideus for the production of antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk and to characterize the peptides. Here we have used 9% skim milk as the substrate and fermented it with the mycelia of N. lepideus. The fermented milk exhibited higher angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity as compared to the commercially available sour milk containing Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro. As a result of isolation and purification by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by peptide sequencing and MS analysis, the dipeptide Tyr-Pro (YP) was identified as an active peptide. The concentration of YP in the fermented milk reached up to 450 μg/ml, which was > twofold higher than the IC50 for ACE inhibition. Subsequently, the antihypertensive effect of YP was validated through intravenous injection of the peptide, which exhibited a significant lowering of blood pressure in a rat model of genetic hypertension. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis revealed the probable role of the carboxypeptidases for the increased yield of YP. These results together indicated that the fermentation with basidiomycete fungus could be a viable approach to produce bioactive peptides, and may, therefore, be applicable in the development of a cost-effective mass production system for functional peptides.	10.1002/(SICI)1099-1387(199901)5:1<32::AID-PSC172>3.0.CO;2-9

In silico digestion of milk protein-derived peptides with gastrointestinal enzyme activities was used to predict the release of peptides with a Pro residue at position 2 from the N terminus. These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.097

Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation.

WI	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	144-145	DPP-IV Inhibitory		138.7				Identification of short peptide sequences in the nanofiltration permeate of a bioactive whey protein hydrolysate	Le Maux, S. et al.	Short peptides in food protein hydrolysates are of significant interest as they may be highly bioactive whilst also being bioavailable. A dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) was fractionated using nanofiltration (NF) with a 200 Da MWCO membrane. The DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration of the NF permeate (IC50 = 0.66 ± 0.08 mg protein equivalent mL− 1) was significantly more potent (P > 0.05) than that of the starting WPH (IC50 = 0.94 ± 0.24 mg protein equivalent mL− 1) and associated retentate (IC50 = 0.82 ± 0.13 mg protein equivalent mL− 1). This confirmed the contribution of short peptides within the NF permeate to the overall DPP-IV inhibitory activity. An hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC-) and reverse-phase (RP-) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) strategy, based on two retention time models, allowed detection of eight free amino acids and eight di- to tetrapeptides in the NF permeate. The potential sequences of the peptides within the NF permeate were then ranked on the basis of their highest probability of occurrence. A confirmatory study with synthetic peptides showed that valine–alanine (VA), valine–leucine (VL), tryptophan–leucine (WL) and tryptophan–isoleucine (WI) displayed DPP-IV IC50 values < 170 μM. The NF and LC–MS strategies employed herein represent a new approach for the targeted identification of short peptides within bioactive food protein hydrolysates.	10.1016/j.foodres.2015.09.012

IPM	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	490-492	DPP-IV Inhibitory		69.5				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-60	Anticancer	Cytotoxic for leukemic cells					Apoptosis in Human Leukemic Cells Induced by Lactoferricin, a Bovine Milk Protein-Derived Peptide: Involvement of Reactive Oxygen Species	Yoo, Y-C. et al.	We examined the activity of bovine lactoferricin (Lfcin-B), a peptide derived from a bovine milk protein lactoferrin (LF-B), to induce apoptosis in THP-1 human monocytic leukemic cells. Treatment with Lfcin-B at up to 50 μg/ml induced cell death in THP-1 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner, showing apparent morphological changes, hypodiploid forms of genomic DNA and apoptotic DNA fragmentation, whereas LF-B was inactive even at a high dose (500 μg/ml). The apoptosis-inducing effect of Lfcin-B increased with reduction of serum concentration, but was inhibited by addition of Zn2+, a inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Lfcin-B-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells was completely abolished by addition of antioxidants such asN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH), but not by various cytokines and mitogen which can activate monocytic cells. In addition, THP-1 cells treated with Lfcin-B, but not LF-B, showed high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the early period (20 min) of Lfcin-B treatment. And the production of ROS by Lfcin-B was dependent upon the dose of Lfcin-B added. These results suggested that Lfcin-B, a LF-B-derived peptide, but not LF-B itself, is able to induce apoptosis in THP-1 human monocytic tumor cells, and that its apoptosis-inducing activity is related to the pathway mediated by production of the intracellular ROS and activation of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases.	10.1006/bbrc.1997.7199

A physiologically diverse range of Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 μg/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony‐forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.	10.1111/j.1365-2672.1992.tb05007.x

A series of peptides derived from sequences from human, bovine, murine and caprine lactoferrin has been prepared and investigated for antibacterial effect. Among the four species investigated peptides based on the bovine sequence displayed significant activity. The bovine sequence, bovine lactoferricin, showed a MIC value of 30 μg/mL on E. coli and S. aureus, whereas the three other lactoferricins possessed MIC values above 200 μg/mL.

FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-60	Antimicrobial						Lactoferrin derived peptides antimicrobial activity: an in vitro experiment	Biasibetti, E. et al.	Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, searching for new antimicrobial agents is an urgent need. In this study, in vitro antibacterial and antimicrobial effects of milk-derived antimicrobial agents, lactoferrin-derived peptides, lactoferricin (Lfc) and lactoferrampin (Lfa) (alone or in combination) and their association with natural extracts have been explored. The assessment of antimicrobial activity was based on two measurements: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Fractional Inhibitory Concentration indexes. Lfc alone is more suitable for inhibiting Staphylococcus intermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis, while Lfa against Candida albicans, a synergistic effect of the two peptides against all the three pathogens has been detected. A strong synergy of all the natural extracts with Lfc and Lfa solution against selected microorganisms in vitro was pointed out. Our results suggest that natural-derived compounds, such as milk peptides and vegetal extracts could be promising tools to treat moderate fungal and bacterial infections.	10.1080/14786419.2020.1821017

Antimicrobial peptides derived from food proteins constitute a new field in the combined use of antimicrobial agents in food. The best examples of milk-derived peptides are those constituted by bovine lactoferricin [lactoferrin f(17–41)] (LFcin-B) and bovine αs2-casein f(183–207). The aim of this work was to study if the antimicrobial activity of a natural compound employed in food preservation, nisin, could be enhanced by combination with the aforementioned milk-derived peptides. Furthermore, the possibility of a synergistic effect between these peptides and bovine lactoferrin (LF) against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis was also studied. Finally, the most active combinations were assayed against the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella choleraesuis. Results showed a synergistic effect when LFcin-B was combined with bovine LF against E. coli. In the same way, the combination of LFcin-B with bovine LF was synergistic against Staph. epidermidis. Bovine LF and nisin increased their antimicrobial activity when they were assayed together with bovine αs2-casein f(183-207). It is important to note the synergistic effect among LFcin-B and bovine LF, because both compounds might be simultaneously in the suckling gastrointestinal tract and could, therefore, have a protective effect on it. The other synergistic effect high-lighted is that between αs2-casein f(183–207) and nisin against L. monocytogenes because of the ability of L. monocytogenes to develop resistance to nisin.	10.3168/jds.2007-0037
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-60	Antimicrobial						The Bovine Antimicrobial Peptide Lactoferricin Interacts with Polysialic Acid without Loss of Its Antimicrobial Activity against Escherichia coli	Kuhnle, A. et al.	Bovine milk contains a high concentration of the protein lactoferrin. It is an important antimicrobial biomolecule, which is also present in other bodily fluids like blood and semen. However, not only the intact protein but also its cleavage products have antimicrobial activity. Perhaps, the best-known cleavage product of lactoferrin is the peptide lactoferricin that has significant antimicrobial capacity against a broad range of pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Interestingly, lactoferricin can interact with the sugar polymer polysialic acid, which is also present in milk, blood, and semen. In the present study, we tested if the binding to polysialic acid influences the biological activity of bovine lactoferricin. Remarkably, neither different amounts of polysialic acid nor different chain lengths of this sugar polymer influenced the antimicrobial activity of lactoferricin. The ability of polysialic acid to bind and not inactivate lactoferricin may allow the development of novel endogenous and biodegradable polysialylated surfaces and/or hydrogels, which can be loaded with the antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin for biomedical applications in veterinary and human medicine.	10.3390/ani10010001
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-60	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli		Comparison of NMR structures and model-membrane interactions of 15-residue antimicrobial peptides derived from bovine lactoferricin	Weiguo, J. et al.	LFB (FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA-HN2) is a 15-residue linear antimicrobial peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin, which has antimicrobial activity similar to that of the intact 25-residue disulfide-cyclized peptide. Previous alanine-scan studies, in which all of the residues in LFB were individually replaced with Ala, showed that the 2 tryptophan (Trp) residues of LFB were crucial to its antimicrobial activity. When either Trp6 or Trp8 was replaced with Ala (LFBA6 and LFBA8, respectively), these 2 peptides were almost devoid of antimicrobial activity. We determined the structures of LFB, LFBA6, and LFBA8 bound to membrane-mimetic SDS micelles using NMR spectroscopy, and studied their interactions with different phospholipid-model membranes. The membrane interactions of LFB exhibited little correlation with its antimicrobial activity, suggesting that the mechanism of action of LFB involves intracellular targets. However, the much higher antimicrobial activity of LFB compared with LFBA6 and LFBA8 might result, in part, from the formation of energetically favorable cation-pi interactions observed only in LFB. Information about the importance of Arg and Trp cation-pi interactions will provide insight for the future design of potent antimicrobial peptidomimetics.	10.1139/o06-052
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-60	Antimicrobial						Lactoferricin, a new antimicrobial peptide	Jones, EM. et al.	Lactoferricin B (LF‐B) is a peptide derived from acid‐pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin, which has antimicrobial properties. In order to assess the antimicrobial spectrum of LF‐B and its possible in vivo uses, the minimum inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations of pure lactoferricin B were determined for a range of bacterial species and under varying conditions of growth including growth phase and size of the inoculum, pH and ionic strength of the medium. Lactoferricin B was bactericidal against a wide range of bacteria and Candida albicans. Proteus spp., Pseudomonas cepacia and Serratia spp. were resistant. The bactericidal activity of LF‐B was inhibited by increasing ionic strength and bacterial inoculum and at acid pH. The activity of lactoferricin B was completely inhibited by the addition of 5% whole cow's milk and was reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of mucin. These results indicate the potential of LF‐B to reduce the numbers of organisms in a simple medium, but raise doubts about its role in vivo because of its sensitivity to changes in physical variables. It may be that lactoferricin exerts a transient antimicrobial effect at mucosal surfaces.	10.1111/j.1365-2672.1994.tb03065.x

Treatment of Caco-2 cells with the peptide lactoferricin4–14, results in reduction of the growth rate by prolongation of the S phase of the cell cycle. Lactoferricin1–25 is formed in the gut by cleavage from lactoferrin and the bioactive amino acids are found within lactoferricin4–14. Our hypothesis is that the reduction of the rate of S phase progression may result in increased DNA repair. To test this hypothesis, Caco-2 cells were subjected to UV light that caused DNA lesions and then the cells were grown in the absence or presence of 2.0 μM lactoferricin4–14. Evaluation of DNA strand breaks using the comet assay showed that lactoferricin4–14 treatment indeed resulted in a reduction of comets showing damaged DNA. In the search for a mechanism, we have investigated the levels of several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and apoptosis using Western blot. Lactoferricin4–14 treatment resulted in an increased expression of flap endonuclease-1 pointing to increased DNA synthesis activity. Lactoferricin4–14 treatment decreased the expression of the proapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (or Bax), indicating decreased cell death. As we have found previously, lactoferricin4–14 treatment reduced the expression of cyclin E involved in the G1/S transition. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that a lower γ-H2AX expression in lactoferricin4–14-treated cells, pointing to more efficient DNA repair. Thus, altogether our data show that lactoferricin4–14 treatment has beneficial effects.	10.3168/jds.2011-5279
CFQWQRNMRKVRGPPVSCIKRD	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	38-59	Cell Penetrating						A Cell-penetrating Peptide Derived from Human Lactoferrin with Conformation-dependent Uptake Efficiency	Duchardt, F. et al.	The molecular events that contribute to the cellular uptake of cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are still a matter of intense research. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a 22-amino acid CPP derived from the human milk protein, lactoferrin. The peptide exhibits a conformation-dependent uptake efficiency that is correlated with efficient binding to heparan sulfate and lipid-induced conformational changes. The peptide contains a disulfide bridge formed by terminal cysteine residues. At concentrations exceeding 10 μm, this peptide undergoes the same rapid entry into the cytoplasm that was described previously for the arginine-rich CPPs nona-arginine and Tat. Cytoplasmic entry strictly depends on the presence of the disulfide bridge. To better understand this conformation dependence, NMR spectroscopy was performed for the free peptide, and CD measurements were performed for free and lipid-bound peptide. In solution, the peptides showed only slight differences in secondary structure, with a predominantly disordered structure both in the presence and absence of the disulfide bridge. In contrast, in complex with large unilamellar vesicles, the conformation of the oxidized and reduced forms of the peptide clearly differed. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance experiments showed that the oxidized form binds to heparan sulfate with a considerably higher affinity than the reduced form. Consistently, membrane binding and cellular uptake of the peptide were reduced when heparan sulfate chains were removed.	10.1074/jbc.M109.036426

The antimicrobial activity of lactoferrin isolated from Korean native goat (KN goat) milk was studied and its antimicrobial domain was identified using synthetic peptides. Antimicrobial activity was assayed by a micro-method using 96-well microplates and a microplate reader. The amino acid sequence of the antimicrobial domain was suggested to be YQWQRRMRKLGAPSIT and this sequence corresponds to amino acid residues 20 to 35 of KN goat lactoferrin. Five peptides with certain amino acid residues deleted were synthesized in an effort to identify the residues essential for antimicrobial activity and it was found that the part with the sequence RRMRK (24–28) is the region most important for this activity. On the other hand, the conformation of the peptides did not influence the antimicrobial activity.	10.1006/bbrc.2000.2141
YQWQRRMRKL	Q29477	Lactotransferrin	Capra hircus	39-48	Antimicrobial			MIC	 E. coli		Antibacterial activity of short hydrophobic and basic-rich peptides	Chen, PW. et al.	"Objective—To design short and potent analogs of bovine lactoferricin by use of the concepts of lipophilic bulk and cationic charge.
Sample Population—5 synthetic peptides of bovine lactoferricin.
Procedure—Antibacterial peptides were constructed by synthesizing several decapeptides rich in arginine and tryptophan. Basic residues of bovine lactoferricin (bLf 20-29; residues 20 to 29) were modified by substitution with arginine or lysine and nonbasic residues were modified by substitution with tryptophan, phenylalanine, or isoleucine. Synthetic peptides of bovine lactoferrin (LFB) were designated as LFB-RW (RRWWWRWRRW), LFB-KW (KKWWWKWKKW), LFB-RWa (RRWWRRWRRW), LFB-RF (RRFFFRFRRF), and LFB-RI (RRIIIRWRRI), where R, K, W, F, and I stand for arginine, lysine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and isoleucine, respectively. Peptides were evaluated by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,and Enterococcus faecalis.
Results—LFB-RW, LFB-KW, and LFB-RWa possessed equivalent potency as bLf 20-29 against E coli. LFB-RW and LFB-RWa had a 2-fold increase in growth-inhibitory and bactericidal activity against S aureus, compared with bLf 20-29. LFB-RI had the lowest MIC value against E coli among the peptides but lost bactericidal activity. LFB-RW and LFB-KW had stronger bactericidal activities against S aureus or E faecalis, respectively, as well as E coli than the other synthetic peptides. LFB-RF also had antibacterial activity, but this was 2-fold less than that of LFBRW, as determined by MIC and MBC values.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—In construction of potent antibacterial peptides, inclusion of arginine, lysine, tryptophan, or isoleucine residues enhances effectiveness against certain bacteria, as measured by MIC or MBC values. (Am J Vet Res 2003;64:1088–1092)"	10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.1088

WNLLRQAQEKFGKDKSPK	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	287-304	Antimicrobial	HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase-inhibitory			HIV-1		A study of effects of peptide fragments of bovine and human lactoferrins on activities of three key HIV-1 enzymes	Wong, JH. et al.	The intent of this study was to examine human and bovine lactoferrin fragments including lactoferrin (1-11), lactoferricin and lactoferrampin, all of which did not demonstrate hemolytic activity toward rabbit erythrocytes at 1 mM concentration, for possible inhibitory effects on the activities of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase. The data showed that human lactoferricin was the most potent in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (IC50 =2 μM). Bovine lactoferricin (IC50 = 10 μM) and bovine lactoferrampin (IC50 = 150 μM) were less potent. Human lactoferrampin and human and bovine lactoferrin (1-11) at 1 mM concentration did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. All peptides showed only a slight inhibitory effect (from slightly below 2% to 6% inhibition) on HIV-1 protease. Human lactoferrampin and bovine lactoferrampin showed obvious inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase at 37 μM and 18.5 μM, respectively. The HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity of human lactoferrampin and bovine lactoferrampin was dose-dependent. The other peptides were devoid of HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity. Thus, it is concluded that some lactoferrin fragments exert an inhibitory action on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 integrase.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.07.006
WNLLRQAQEKFGKDKSP	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	287-303	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli C. albicans S. sanguinis		Novel lactoferrampin antimicrobial peptides derived from human lactoferrin	Haney, EF. et al.	Human lactoferrampin is a novel antimicrobial peptide found in the cationic N-terminal lobe of the iron-binding human lactoferrin protein. The amino acid sequence that directly corresponds to the previously characterized bovine lactoferrin-derived lactoferrampin peptide is inactive on its own (WNLLRQAQEKFGKDKSP, residues 269–285). However, by increasing the net positive charge near the C-terminal end of human lactoferrampin, a significant increase in its antibacterial and Candidacidal activity was obtained. Conversely, the addition of an N-terminal helix cap (sequence DAI) did not have any appreciable effect on the antibacterial or antifungal activity of human lactoferrampin peptides, even though it markedly influenced that of bovine lactoferrampin. The solution structure of five human lactoferrampin variants was determined in SDS micelles and all of the structures display a well-defined amphipathic N-terminal helix and a flexible cationic C-terminus. Differential scanning calorimetry studies indicate that this peptide is capable of inserting into the hydrophobic core of a membrane, while fluorescence spectroscopy results suggest that a hydrophobic patch encompassing the single Trp and Phe residues as well as Leu, Ile and Ala side chains mediates the interaction between the peptide and the hydrophobic core of a phospholipid bilayer.	10.1016/j.biochi.2008.04.013

Antimicrobial peptides have been found throughout living nature, yet antimicrobial sequences may still lie hidden within a wide variety of proteins. A rational strategy was developed to select interesting domains, based on the presumed common features of antimicrobial peptides, and to release these from accessible and safe proteins. In silico proteolysis simulations of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) with selected endoproteinases predicted the liberation of peptides that encompasses a cationic amphipathic α-helix. Three predicted peptides were synthesized and tested for their biological activity, demonstrating that one single enzyme was sufficient to obtain an antimicrobial peptide. The proof of principle demonstrated that a 32-mer fragment isolated from the endoproteinase AspN digestion of bLF possessed strong antimicrobial activity. Moreover, desalted crude digest had improved activity over native bLF. Hence, selective digestion of bLF Increase its antimicrobial activity by release of antimicrobial stretches.	10.1016/j.peptides.2005.06.012
WKLLSKAQEKFGKNKSR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	287-303	Antimicrobial			MIC	C. albicans		Lactoferrampin, an antimicrobial peptide of bovine lactoferrin, exerts its candidacidal activity by a cluster of positively charged residues at the C-terminus in combination with a helix-facilitating N-terminal part	Van Der Kraan, MIA. et al.	The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is attributed to lactoferricin, which is situated in the N1-domain of bLF. Recently, another antimicrobial domain consisting of residues 268–284, designated lactoferrampin (LFampin), has been identified in the N1-domain of bLF, which exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and several bacteria. In the present study, the candidacidal activity of a series of peptides spanning this antimicrobial domain was investigated in relation to the charge and the capacity to form a helical conformation in hydrophobic environments. C-Terminal truncation of LFampin resulted in a drastic decrease in candidacidal activity. Positively charged residues clustered at the C-terminal side of the LFampin domain appeared to be crucial for the candidacidal activity. The ability to adopt helical conformations did not change when LFampin was truncated at the C-terminal side. N-Terminally truncated LFampin peptides, truncated up to the sequence 270–284, were more reluctant to adopt a helical conformation. Therefore, we conclude that the C-terminal part of LFampin 265–284, which is the most active peptide, is crucial for its candidacidal activity, due to the presence of clustered positive charges, and that the N-terminal part is essential for activity as it facilitates helix formation.	10.1515/BC.2005.017
TRVVWCAVG	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	362-370	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli B. subtilis		Novel antibacterial lactoferrin peptides generated by rennet digestion and autofocusing technique	Elbarbary, H. et al.	Bovine lactoferrin was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including calf rennet, fungal rennin, and porcine pepsin. Lactoferrin hydrolysates were assessed for their antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. At pH 3, calf rennet lactoferrin hydrolysate before (LFH) showed the highest antimicrobial activity, then pepsin LFH, while fungal rennin LFH was the least active. The calf rennet and pepsin LFH were fractionated using autofocusing and chromatographic techniques. The activity-guided fractionation of calf rennet LFH identified a potent antimicrobial peptide of 11-residues, lactoferricin B (Lf-cin B), and three other novel antibacterial peptides. The 11-residues Lf-cin B was the most potent antibacterial peptide and was isolated from both rennet and pepsin LFH. Pepsin LFH had a main antimicrobial peptide of 25-residues, which was not detected in calf rennet LFH. It could be concluded that calf rennet LFH had stronger antibacterial properties than porcine pepsin LFH. Besides, autofocusing could be used for scaling up the isolation of the potent rennet LFH peptides that would have a widespread commercial use as a natural food preservative substituting porcine pepsin digest, especially in Islamic communities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.12.019
TKCFQWQRNMRKVRGPPVSCIKRDS	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	36-60	Antimicrobial	Human cytomegalovirus					Lactoferrin and cyclic lactoferricin inhibit the entry of human cytomegalovirus into human fibroblasts	Andersen, JH. et al.	Lactoferrin is mainly produced by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and has been demonstrated in mammalian milk and external secretions. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding, multifunctional protein and may play an important role in immune regulation and in defense mechanisms against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Lactoferricin is a potent antimicrobial peptide generated from the N-terminal part of lactoferrin by pepsin cleavage. We demonstrate that lactoferrins from different species and its N-terminal peptide lactoferricin (particularly the cyclic form) inhibit expression of early and late antigens, as well as production of infectious viral progeny during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in vitro. Iron-saturated lactoferrin did not affect HCMV antigen expression. Heparin had the same effects as iron-depleted lactoferrin. Yet, mixtures of lactoferrin and heparin did not inhibit HCMV multiplication i.e. lactoferrin and heparin seemed to mutually block each other's antiviral activities. HCMV-infected cells exposed to lactoferrin and cyclic lactoferricin contained less intracellular virus than unexposed cells. The antiviral activity of cyclic lactoferricin was more than seven-fold weaker than that of the maternal molecule. Lactoferrin and cyclic lactoferricin prevented HCMV entrance into the host cell.	10.1016/s0166-3542(01)00146-2

Peptides derived from the N-terminal domain that comprises an amphipathic α-helix in human lactoferrin (LFh 18–31 and LFh 20–38) and bovine lactoferrin (LFb 17–30 and LFb 19–37) were chemically synthesised. Since many positively charged amphipathic α-helices contain antimicrobial activity, the peptides were tested for their antimicrobial activity against various oral pathogens. Both peptides from bovine lactoferrin had more potent antimicrobial activities than the human equivalents. Peptide LFb 17–30, containing the largest number of positively charged amino acids, showed the highest antimicrobial activity to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Since native lactoferrin molecules had no killing activity, release of these peptides from the native protein should be investigated to explore the use in oral care products.	10.1111/j.1574-6968.1999.tb08730.x

There is a need for new microbicidal agents with therapeutic potential due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria and fungi. In this study, the structure-microbicidal activity relationship of amino acid residues 14 to 31 (sequence 14-31) from the N-terminal end, corresponding to the antibacterial α-helix of human lactoferrin (LF), was investigated by downsizing, alanine scanning, and substitution of amino acids. Microbicidal analysis (99% killing) was performed by a microplate assay using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans as test organisms. Starting from the N-terminal end, downsizing of peptide sequence 14-31 showed that the peptide sequence 19-31 (KCFQWQRNMRKVR, HL9) was the optimal length for antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, HL9 bound to lipid A/lipopolysaccharide, as shown by neutralizing endotoxic activity in a Limulus assay. Alanine scanning of peptide sequence 20-31 showed that Cys20, Trp23, Arg28, Lys29, or Arg31 was important for expressing full killing activity, particularly against C. albicans. Substituting the neutral hydrophilic amino acids Gln24 and Asn26 for Lys and Ala (HLopt2), respectively, enhanced microbicidal activity significantly against all test organisms compared to the amino acids natural counterpart, also, in comparison with HL9, HLopt2 had more than 10-fold-stronger fungicidal activity. Furthermore, HLopt2 was less affected by metallic salts than HL9. The microbicidal activity of HLopt2 was slightly reduced only at pH 7.0, as tested in the pH range of 4.5 to 7.5. The results showed that the microbicidal activity of synthetic peptide sequences, based on the antimicrobial α-helix region of LF, can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the length and substitution of neutral amino acids at specific positions, thus suggesting a sequence lead with therapeutic potential.	10.1128/AAC.00908-09

This study investigated the antimicrobial activities of peptides derived from the N-terminal region of human lactoferrin, and examined the contributions of individual residues to the activity of the most potent peptide. Two regions of antimicrobial activity were identified, the first corresponding to a weakly active peptide, HLP-9, comprising residues 1–9, and a second corresponding to a more potent peptide, HLP-10, comprising residues 18–26 and containing the hexapeptide motif, FQWQRN. Inhibitory studies on peptides from the first region confirm the importance of tryptophan residues in enhancing and broadening peptide activity. Inhibitory studies with glycine-substituted homologues of the more potent peptide showed that F21/G and R25/G substitutions resulted in a major reduction or complete loss of activity, while increased peptide cationicity or flexibility had little effect. Our findings demonstrate that F21 and R25 are critical determinants of potency for HLP-10, and that the second aromatic residue may act synergistically with W23 in developing and enhancing the activity of this cationic peptide.	10.1016/j.femsle.2004.08.048

Lactoferricins are a class of antibacterial peptides isolated after gastric-pepsin digest of the mammalian iron-chelating-protein lactoferrin. For investigation of antibacterial activity, we prepared short synthetic derivatives of bovine, human, caprine, murine and porcine lactoferricins with 15-amino-acid residues of high sequence homology. The peptides corresponded to amino-acid residues 17–31 of the mature bovine lactoferrin. Only the bovine and caprine derivatives displayed measurable antibacterial activity, with the bovine one having a minimal inhibitory concentration of 24 µm and being 10 times more active than the caprine one against Escherichia coli. An alanine-scan of the bovine lactoferricin derivative was performed to identify specific amino acids that were important for the antibacterial activity. We found that neither of the two tryptophan residues (Trp 6 and Trp 8) present in the bovine lactoferricin derivative could be replaced by alanine without a major loss of antibacterial activity. The other lactoferricin derivatives tested contained only one tryptophan residue (Trp 6). Modified human, caprine and porcine lactoferricin derivatives containing two tryptophan residues (Trp 6 and Trp 8) displayed minimal inhibitory concentrations of 74, 174 and 219 µm, respectively, which represented up to a six-fold increase in antibacterial activity. The alanine-scan also revealed that the antibacterial activity was increased when acetamidomethyl-protected cysteine and unprotected glutamine (Cys 3 and Gln 7) were replaced with alanine. Only the bovine lactoferricin derivative and a few of its alanine-modified derivatives displayed measurable activity against Staphylococcus aureus.	10.1034/j.1399-3011.2000.00770.x

A series of peptides derived from sequences from human, bovine, murine and caprine lactoferrin has been prepared and investigated for antibacterial effect. Among the four species investigated peptides based on the bovine sequence displayed significant activity. The bovine sequence, bovine lactoferricin, showed a MIC value of 30 μg/mL on E. coli and S. aureus, whereas the three other lactoferricins possessed MIC values above 200 μg/mL.

The antimicrobial peptide, lactoferricin, is generated upon the gastric pepsin cleavage of lactoferrin and has many basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues essential for its biological activity. To investigate the structure-antimicrobial activity relationships, the basic amino acid-rich region of bovine lactoferricin (BLFC), RRWQWRMKKLG, was selected. Using chemically synthesized BLFC and its substituted peptides, the antimicrobial activities of the peptides were tested by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the disruption of the outer cell membrane of E. coli, and the peptide's toxicities were assayed by hemolysis. The short peptide (B3) composed of only 11 residues had similar antimicrobial activities while losing most of the hemolytic activities as compared with the 25 residue-long ones (B1 and B2). The short peptides (B3, B5 and B7) with double arginines at the N-termini had more potent antimicrobial activity than those (B4 and B6) with lysine. However, no antimicrobial and hemolytic activities were found in B8, in which all basic amino acids were substituted with glutamic acid, and in B9, in which all hydrophobic amino acids were substituted with alanine. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the short peptides in 30 MM SDS were correlated with their antimicrobial activities. These results suggested that the 11-residue peptide of BLFC is involved in the interaction with bacterial phospholipid membranes and plays an important role in antimicrobial activity with little or no hemolytic activity. © Munksgaard 1996.	10.1111/j.1399-3011.1996.tb00852.x
RRWQWRMKK	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	39-47	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli S. aureus C. albicans		Synthetic Porcine Lactoferricin with a 20-Residue Peptide Exhibits Antimicrobial Activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans	Chen, H-L. et al.	Lactoferricins are positively charged, highly basic peptides that are generated upon gastric pepsin cleavage of various lactoferrins. In the past decade, there has been active investigation of the key antimicrobial segments of the various shorter synthetic bovine and human lactoferricins, but not in porcine lactoferricin. These studies have demonstrated the distinct solution structures of lactoferricin in bovine and human and established the multifunctional nature of the antibacterial, antifungal, antiendotoxin, and antiviral activities of lactoferricins. However, the protective effects of porcine lactoferricins have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, a series of synthetic derivatives of porcine, bovine, and human lactoferricins with 20-residue and 9-residue peptides were prepared to investigate their antimicrobial nature. We found that the 20-residue porcine lactoferricin (LFcin P-20) displayed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, and Candida albicans ATCC14053. The minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of LFcin P-20 ranged from 12 to 25 μM when tested in bacteria and fungi. LFcin P-20 was 4 times more effective than human lactoferricin (LFcin H-20), but slightly less effective than bovine lactoferricin (LFcin B-20).	10.1021/jf053031s

Since human lactoferrin (hLF) binds to bacterial products through its highly positively charged N terminus, we investigated which of the two cationic domains is involved in its bactericidal activity. The results revealed that hLF lacking the first three residues (hLF−3N) was less efficient than hLF in killing of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both hLF preparations failed to kill Escherichia coli O54. In addition, hLF−3N was less effective than hLF in reducing the number of viable bacteria in mice infected with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. Studies with synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 11 N-terminal amino acids, designated hLF(1–11), and fragments thereof demonstrated that peptides lacking the first three N-terminal residues are less effective than hLF(1–11) in killing of bacteria. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to residues 21 to 31, which comprises the second cationic domain, was less effective than hLF(1–11) in killing of bacteria in vitro and in mice having an infection with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. Using fluorescent probes, we found that bactericidal hLF peptides, but not nonbactericidal peptides, caused an increase of the membrane permeability. In addition, hLF killed the various bacteria, most probably by inducing intracellular changes in these bacteria without affecting the membrane permeability. Together, hLF and peptides derived from its N terminus are highly effective against infections with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, and the first two arginines play an essential role in this activity.	10.1128/IAI.69.3.1469-1476.2001

Lactoferricins are positively charged, highly basic peptides that are generated upon gastric pepsin cleavage of various lactoferrins. In the past decade, there has been active investigation of the key antimicrobial segments of the various shorter synthetic bovine and human lactoferricins, but not in porcine lactoferricin. These studies have demonstrated the distinct solution structures of lactoferricin in bovine and human and established the multifunctional nature of the antibacterial, antifungal, antiendotoxin, and antiviral activities of lactoferricins. However, the protective effects of porcine lactoferricins have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, a series of synthetic derivatives of porcine, bovine, and human lactoferricins with 20-residue and 9-residue peptides were prepared to investigate their antimicrobial nature. We found that the 20-residue porcine lactoferricin (LFcin P-20) displayed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, and Candida albicans ATCC14053. The minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of LFcin P-20 ranged from 12 to 25 μM when tested in bacteria and fungi. LFcin P-20 was 4 times more effective than human lactoferricin (LFcin H-20), but slightly less effective than bovine lactoferricin (LFcin B-20).	10.1021/jf053031s

There is a need for new microbicidal agents with therapeutic potential due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria and fungi. In this study, the structure-microbicidal activity relationship of amino acid residues 14 to 31 (sequence 14-31) from the N-terminal end, corresponding to the antibacterial α-helix of human lactoferrin (LF), was investigated by downsizing, alanine scanning, and substitution of amino acids. Microbicidal analysis (99% killing) was performed by a microplate assay using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans as test organisms. Starting from the N-terminal end, downsizing of peptide sequence 14-31 showed that the peptide sequence 19-31 (KCFQWQRNMRKVR, HL9) was the optimal length for antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, HL9 bound to lipid A/lipopolysaccharide, as shown by neutralizing endotoxic activity in a Limulus assay. Alanine scanning of peptide sequence 20-31 showed that Cys20, Trp23, Arg28, Lys29, or Arg31 was important for expressing full killing activity, particularly against C. albicans. Substituting the neutral hydrophilic amino acids Gln24 and Asn26 for Lys and Ala (HLopt2), respectively, enhanced microbicidal activity significantly against all test organisms compared to the amino acids natural counterpart, also, in comparison with HL9, HLopt2 had more than 10-fold-stronger fungicidal activity. Furthermore, HLopt2 was less affected by metallic salts than HL9. The microbicidal activity of HLopt2 was slightly reduced only at pH 7.0, as tested in the pH range of 4.5 to 7.5. The results showed that the microbicidal activity of synthetic peptide sequences, based on the antimicrobial α-helix region of LF, can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the length and substitution of neutral amino acids at specific positions, thus suggesting a sequence lead with therapeutic potential.	10.1128/AAC.00908-09

A cation-exchange chromatographic membrane was used for the rapid isolation of caprine and ovine lactoferrin (LF) from cheese whey. Caprine LF was isolated by one-step cation-exchange chromatography, but the isolation of ovine LF needed a further reversed-phase HPLC purification step. The antibacterial activity of these LFs, determined towards Micrococcus flavus and Escherichia coli, was compared with that of bovine LF. Of the apo-LFs the caprine protein had the highest activity. In all cases the holo-LFs showed low or negligible activity. The antibacterial properties of cationic peptides obtained by peptic hydrolysis of caprine LF were studied against E. coli and M. flavus, and the activity of these peptides was compared with that of bovine lactoferricin. In addition, the binding characteristics of bovine, ovine and caprine LF to bacterial cells of E. coli were investigated with an enzyme-linked binding assay using horseradish peroxidase-bovine LF as a conjugate. Ovine and bovine LF strongly inhibited the binding of the LF complex to the bacterial surface. The iron-free forms of these LFs showed a greater ability for binding to the bacterial cells than the iron-saturated forms. However, several cationic peptides and caprine LF did not inhibit the binding of the LF conjugate although they exhibited a marked antibacterial effect. The results of binding of the LF complex in the presence of LFs from different species and of membrane-active peptides are discussed in relation to the antibacterial activity of these proteins and peptides.	10.1016/S0958-6946(00)00089-3

The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is attributed to lactoferricin, which is situated in the N1-domain of bLF. Recently, another antimicrobial domain consisting of residues 268–284, designated lactoferrampin (LFampin), has been identified in the N1-domain of bLF, which exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and several bacteria. In the present study, the candidacidal activity of a series of peptides spanning this antimicrobial domain was investigated in relation to the charge and the capacity to form a helical conformation in hydrophobic environments. C-Terminal truncation of LFampin resulted in a drastic decrease in candidacidal activity. Positively charged residues clustered at the C-terminal side of the LFampin domain appeared to be crucial for the candidacidal activity. The ability to adopt helical conformations did not change when LFampin was truncated at the C-terminal side. N-Terminally truncated LFampin peptides, truncated up to the sequence 270–284, were more reluctant to adopt a helical conformation. Therefore, we conclude that the C-terminal part of LFampin 265–284, which is the most active peptide, is crucial for its candidacidal activity, due to the presence of clustered positive charges, and that the N-terminal part is essential for activity as it facilitates helix formation.	10.1515/BC.2005.017

Bovine lactoferrin was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including calf rennet, fungal rennin, and porcine pepsin. Lactoferrin hydrolysates were assessed for their antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. At pH 3, calf rennet lactoferrin hydrolysate before (LFH) showed the highest antimicrobial activity, then pepsin LFH, while fungal rennin LFH was the least active. The calf rennet and pepsin LFH were fractionated using autofocusing and chromatographic techniques. The activity-guided fractionation of calf rennet LFH identified a potent antimicrobial peptide of 11-residues, lactoferricin B (Lf-cin B), and three other novel antibacterial peptides. The 11-residues Lf-cin B was the most potent antibacterial peptide and was isolated from both rennet and pepsin LFH. Pepsin LFH had a main antimicrobial peptide of 25-residues, which was not detected in calf rennet LFH. It could be concluded that calf rennet LFH had stronger antibacterial properties than porcine pepsin LFH. Besides, autofocusing could be used for scaling up the isolation of the potent rennet LFH peptides that would have a widespread commercial use as a natural food preservative substituting porcine pepsin digest, especially in Islamic communities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.12.019

Several peptides sharing high sequence homology with lactoferricin B (Lf-cin B) were generated from bovine lactoferrin (Lf) with recombinant chymosin. Two peptides were copurified, one identical to Lf-cin B and another differing from Lf-cin B by the inclusion of a C-terminal alanine (lactoferricin). Two other peptides were copurified from chymosin-hydrolyzed Lf, one differing from Lf-cin B by the inclusion of C-terminal alanyl-leucine and the other being a heterodimer linked by a disulfide bond. These peptides were isolated in a single step from chymosin-hydrolyzed Lf by membrane ion-exchange chromatography and were purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). They were characterized by N-terminal Edman sequencing, mass spectrometry, and antibacterial activity determination. Pure lactoferricin, prepared from pepsin-hydrolyzed Lf, was purified by standard chromatography techniques. This peptide was analyzed against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria before and after reduction of its disulfide bond or cleavage after its single methionine residue and was found to inhibit the growth of all the test bacteria at a concentration of 8 microM or less. Subfragments of lactoferricin were isolated from reduced and cleaved peptide by reverse-phase HPLC. Subfragment 1 (residues 1 to 10) was active against most of the test microorganisms at concentrations of 10 to 50 microM. Subfragment 2 (residues 11 to 26) was active against only a few microorganisms at concentrations up to 100 microM. These antibacterial studies indicate that the activity of lactoferricin is mainly, but not wholly, due to its N-terminal region.	10.1128/aac.41.1.54

Lactoferricins are positively charged, highly basic peptides that are generated upon gastric pepsin cleavage of various lactoferrins.

There is a need for new microbicidal agents with therapeutic potential due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria and fungi. In this study, the structure-microbicidal activity relationship of amino acid residues 14 to 31 (sequence 14-31) from the N-terminal end, corresponding to the antibacterial α-helix of human lactoferrin (LF), was investigated by downsizing, alanine scanning, and substitution of amino acids. Microbicidal analysis (99% killing) was performed by a microplate assay using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans as test organisms. Starting from the N-terminal end, downsizing of peptide sequence 14-31 showed that the peptide sequence 19-31 (KCFQWQRNMRKVR, HL9) was the optimal length for antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, HL9 bound to lipid A/lipopolysaccharide, as shown by neutralizing endotoxic activity in a Limulus assay. Alanine scanning of peptide sequence 20-31 showed that Cys20, Trp23, Arg28, Lys29, or Arg31 was important for expressing full killing activity, particularly against C. albicans. Substituting the neutral hydrophilic amino acids Gln24 and Asn26 for Lys and Ala (HLopt2), respectively, enhanced microbicidal activity significantly against all test organisms compared to the amino acids natural counterpart, also, in comparison with HL9, HLopt2 had more than 10-fold-stronger fungicidal activity. Furthermore, HLopt2 was less affected by metallic salts than HL9. The microbicidal activity of HLopt2 was slightly reduced only at pH 7.0, as tested in the pH range of 4.5 to 7.5. The results showed that the microbicidal activity of synthetic peptide sequences, based on the antimicrobial α-helix region of LF, can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the length and substitution of neutral amino acids at specific positions, thus suggesting a sequence lead with therapeutic potential.	10.1128/AAC.00908-09

Since human lactoferrin (hLF) binds to bacterial products through its highly positively charged N terminus, we investigated which of the two cationic domains is involved in its bactericidal activity. The results revealed that hLF lacking the first three residues (hLF−3N) was less efficient than hLF in killing of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both hLF preparations failed to kill Escherichia coli O54. In addition, hLF−3N was less effective than hLF in reducing the number of viable bacteria in mice infected with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. Studies with synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 11 N-terminal amino acids, designated hLF(1–11), and fragments thereof demonstrated that peptides lacking the first three N-terminal residues are less effective than hLF(1–11) in killing of bacteria. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to residues 21 to 31, which comprises the second cationic domain, was less effective than hLF(1–11) in killing of bacteria in vitro and in mice having an infection with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. Using fluorescent probes, we found that bactericidal hLF peptides, but not nonbactericidal peptides, caused an increase of the membrane permeability. In addition, hLF killed the various bacteria, most probably by inducing intracellular changes in these bacteria without affecting the membrane permeability. Together, hLF and peptides derived from its N terminus are highly effective against infections with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, and the first two arginines play an essential role in this activity.	10.1128/IAI.69.3.1469-1476.2001

This study investigated the antimicrobial activities of peptides derived from the N-terminal region of human lactoferrin, and examined the contributions of individual residues to the activity of the most potent peptide. Two regions of antimicrobial activity were identified, the first corresponding to a weakly active peptide, HLP-9, comprising residues 1–9, and a second corresponding to a more potent peptide, HLP-10, comprising residues 18–26 and containing the hexapeptide motif, FQWQRN. Inhibitory studies on peptides from the first region confirm the importance of tryptophan residues in enhancing and broadening peptide activity. Inhibitory studies with glycine-substituted homologues of the more potent peptide showed that F21/G and R25/G substitutions resulted in a major reduction or complete loss of activity, while increased peptide cationicity or flexibility had little effect. Our findings demonstrate that F21 and R25 are critical determinants of potency for HLP-10, and that the second aromatic residue may act synergistically with W23 in developing and enhancing the activity of this cationic peptide.	10.1016/j.femsle.2004.08.048

Human lactoferrin contains a 47 amino acid peptide, named lactoferricin H, which is thought to be responsible for its antimicrobial activity. Lactoferricin includes a loop region, which resides on the outer surface of the N-lobe of lactoferrin, adopting an alpha helix with a hydrophobic tail. Peptides have been synthesised corresponding to the highly charged alpha helix (HLP 2) and hydrophobic tail region (HLP 5). HLP 2 has potent antibacterial activity whereas HLP 5 had no activity. To investigate the relationship between structure and function of HLP 2, HLP 6 was synthesised with a proline replacing methionine. This substitution was predicted to disrupt the helical region of the peptide and the orientation of the positively charged residues. Antibacterial activity was significantly reduced when tested against Escherichia coli serotype 0111, NCTC 8007. The mode of action of HLP 2 against the bacterial membrane was investigated by flow cytometric analysis, using Escherichia coli, NCTC 8007. Membrane potential and integrity were monitored using the fluorescent probes, bis 1,3-(dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol and propidium iodide respectively. HLP 2 caused complete loss of membrane potential and integrity, with irreversible damage to the cell as shown by rapid loss of viability. We conclude that HLP 2 causes membrane disruption and that helicity is an important factor for antibacterial activity.	PMID: 9781361

Several peptides sharing high sequence homology with lactoferricin B (Lf-cin B) were generated from bovine lactoferrin (Lf) with recombinant chymosin. Two peptides were copurified, one identical to Lf-cin B and another differing from Lf-cin B by the inclusion of a C-terminal alanine (lactoferricin). Two other peptides were copurified from chymosin-hydrolyzed Lf, one differing from Lf-cin B by the inclusion of C-terminal alanyl-leucine and the other being a heterodimer linked by a disulfide bond. These peptides were isolated in a single step from chymosin-hydrolyzed Lf by membrane ion-exchange chromatography and were purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). They were characterized by N-terminal Edman sequencing, mass spectrometry, and antibacterial activity determination. Pure lactoferricin, prepared from pepsin-hydrolyzed Lf, was purified by standard chromatography techniques. This peptide was analyzed against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria before and after reduction of its disulfide bond or cleavage after its single methionine residue and was found to inhibit the growth of all the test bacteria at a concentration of 8 microM or less. Subfragments of lactoferricin were isolated from reduced and cleaved peptide by reverse-phase HPLC. Subfragment 1 (residues 1 to 10) was active against most of the test microorganisms at concentrations of 10 to 50 microM. Subfragment 2 (residues 11 to 26) was active against only a few microorganisms at concentrations up to 100 microM.

FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-50	ACE-inhibitory						Lactoferricin-Related Peptides with Inhibitory Effects on ACE-Dependent Vasoconstriction	Centeno, JM. et al.	A selection of lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-related peptides with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effect have been examined using in vitro and ex vivo functional assays. Peptides that were analyzed included a set of sequence-related antimicrobial hexapeptides previously reported and two representative LfcinB-derived peptides. In vitro assays using hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (HHL) and angiotensin I as substrates allowed us to select two hexapeptides, PACEI32 (Ac-RKWHFW-NH2) and PACEI34 (Ac-RKWLFW-NH2), and also a LfcinB-derived peptide, LfcinB17-31 (Ac-FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA-NH2). Ex vivo functional assays using rabbit carotid arterial segments showed PACEI32 (both d- and l-enantiomers) and LfcinB17-31 have inhibitory effects on ACE-dependent angiotensin I-induced contraction. None of the peptides exhibited in vitro ACE inhibitory activity using bradykinin as the substrate. In conclusion, three bioactive lactoferricin-related peptides exhibit inhibitory effects on both ACE activity and ACE-dependent vasoconstriction with potential to modulate hypertension that deserves further investigation.	10.1021/jf060482j
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-50	ACE-inhibitory						Antihypertensive Properties of Lactoferricin β-Derived Peptides	Ruiz-Gimenez, P. et al.	A set of eight lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-derived peptides was examined for inhibitory effects on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and ACE-dependent vasoconstriction, and their hypotensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Peptides were derived from different elongations both at the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the representative peptide LfcinB20−25, which is known as the LfcinB antimicrobial core. All of the eight LfcinB-derived peptides showed in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity with different IC50 values. Moreover, seven of them showed ex vivo inhibitory effects on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. No clear correlation between in vitro and ex vivo inhibitory effects was found. Only LfcinB20−25 and one of its fragments, F1, generated after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion, showed significant antihypertensive effects in SHR after oral administration. Remarkably, F1 did not show any effect on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction in contrast to the inhibitory effect showed by LfcinB20−25. In conclusion, two LfcinB-derived peptides lower blood pressure and exhibit potential as orally effective antihypertensive compounds, yet a complete elucidation of the mechanism(s) involved deserves further ongoing research.	10.1021/jf100899u
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-50	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus		Comparison of NMR structures and model-membrane interactions of 15-residue antimicrobial peptides derived from bovine lactoferricin	Weiguo, J. et al.	LFB (FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA-HN2) is a 15-residue linear antimicrobial peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin, which has antimicrobial activity similar to that of the intact 25-residue disulfide-cyclized peptide. Previous alanine-scan studies, in which all of the residues in LFB were individually replaced with Ala, showed that the 2 tryptophan (Trp) residues of LFB were crucial to its antimicrobial activity. When either Trp6 or Trp8 was replaced with Ala (LFBA6 and LFBA8, respectively), these 2 peptides were almost devoid of antimicrobial activity. We determined the structures of LFB, LFBA6, and LFBA8 bound to membrane-mimetic SDS micelles using NMR spectroscopy, and studied their interactions with different phospholipid-model membranes. The membrane interactions of LFB exhibited little correlation with its antimicrobial activity, suggesting that the mechanism of action of LFB involves intracellular targets. However, the much higher antimicrobial activity of LFB compared with LFBA6 and LFBA8 might result, in part, from the formation of energetically favorable cation-pi interactions observed only in LFB. Information about the importance of Arg and Trp cation-pi interactions will provide insight for the future design of potent antimicrobial peptidomimetics.	10.1139/o06-052
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-50	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus		Antibacterial activity of 15-residue lactoferricinderivatives	Strum, MB. et al.	Lactoferricins are a class of antibacterial peptides isolated after gastric-pepsin digest of the mammalian iron-chelating-protein lactoferrin. For investigation of antibacterial activity, we prepared short synthetic derivatives of bovine, human, caprine, murine and porcine lactoferricins with 15-amino-acid residues of high sequence homology. The peptides corresponded to amino-acid residues 17–31 of the mature bovine lactoferrin. Only the bovine and caprine derivatives displayed measurable antibacterial activity, with the bovine one having a minimal inhibitory concentration of 24 µm and being 10 times more active than the caprine one against Escherichia coli. An alanine-scan of the bovine lactoferricin derivative was performed to identify specific amino acids that were important for the antibacterial activity. We found that neither of the two tryptophan residues (Trp 6 and Trp 8) present in the bovine lactoferricin derivative could be replaced by alanine without a major loss of antibacterial activity. The other lactoferricin derivatives tested contained only one tryptophan residue (Trp 6). Modified human, caprine and porcine lactoferricin derivatives containing two tryptophan residues (Trp 6 and Trp 8) displayed minimal inhibitory concentrations of 74, 174 and 219 µm, respectively, which represented up to a six-fold increase in antibacterial activity. The alanine-scan also revealed that the antibacterial activity was increased when acetamidomethyl-protected cysteine and unprotected glutamine (Cys 3 and Gln 7) were replaced with alanine. Only the bovine lactoferricin derivative and a few of its alanine-modified derivatives displayed measurable activity against Staphylococcus aureus.	10.1034/j.1399-3011.2000.00770.x

Peptides derived from the N-terminal domain that comprises an amphipathic α-helix in human lactoferrin (LFh 18–31 and LFh 20–38) and bovine lactoferrin (LFb 17–30 and LFb 19–37) were chemically synthesised. Since many positively charged amphipathic α-helices contain antimicrobial activity, the peptides were tested for their antimicrobial activity against various oral pathogens. Both peptides from bovine lactoferrin had more potent antimicrobial activities than the human equivalents. Peptide LFb 17–30, containing the largest number of positively charged amino acids, showed the highest antimicrobial activity to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Since native lactoferrin molecules had no killing activity, release of these peptides from the native protein should be investigated to explore the use in oral care products.	10.1111/j.1574-6968.1999.tb08730.x
FKCRRWQWRMKKLG	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-49	Antimicrobial						Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin	Van Der Kraan, MIA. et al.	The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin, situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.	10.1016/j.peptides.2003.12.006
FKCRRWQWRMKKLG	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-49	Antimicrobial			MIC	Antiparasitical MIC (96 Well) L. donovani L. pifanoi		Enhanced leishmanicidal activity of cryptopeptide chimeras from the active N1 domain of bovine lactoferrin	Silva, T. et al.	Two antimicrobial cryptopeptides from the N1 domain of bovine lactoferrin, lactoferricin (LFcin17–30) and lactoferrampin (LFampin265–284), together with a hybrid version (LFchimera), were tested against the protozoan parasite Leishmania. All peptides were leishmanicidal against Leishmania donovani promastigotes, and LFchimera showed a significantly higher activity over its two composing moieties. Besides, it was the only peptide active on Leishmania pifanoi axenic amastigotes, already showing activity below 10 μM. To investigate their leishmanicidal mechanism, promastigote membrane permeabilization was assessed by decrease of free ATP levels in living parasites, entrance of the vital dye SYTOX Green (MW = 600 Da) and confocal and transmission electron microscopy. The peptides induced plasma membrane permeabilization and bioenergetic collapse of the parasites. To further clarify the structural traits underlying the increased leishmanicidal activity of LFchimera, the activity of several analogues was assessed. Results revealed that the high activity of these hybrid peptides seems to be related to the order and sequence orientation of the two cryptopeptide moieties, rather than to their particular linkage through an additional lysine, as in the initial LFchimera. The incorporation of both antimicrobial cryptopeptide motifs into a single linear sequence facilitates chemical synthesis and should help in the potential clinical application of these optimized analogues.	10.1007/s00726-012-1304-0
FKCRRWQWRMK	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-46	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus		The effects of charge and lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of undecapeptides derived from bovine lactoferricin	Stroem, MB. et al.	We have investigated the effects of charge and lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of an undecapeptide (FKCRRWQWRMK) derived from the sequence of bovine lactoferricin. We prepared ten analogues that were modified by the incorporation of Ala, Tyr, Trp, Met and Arg residues, which are amino acids known to be important for the antibacterial activity of longer derivatives of lactoferricins. All undecapeptides contained the native Trp residues in positions 6 and 8, and the Arg residues in positions 5 and 9. Generally, the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to these undecapeptides than the Gram-negative bacteria, and a higher antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli than against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The only exception was the peptide Undeca 9 (RRWYRWAWRMR-NH2), which was almost equally active against all three test strains, displaying minimal inhibitory concentrations of 10 µg/ml (5.8 µM), 7.5 µg/ml (4.4 µM) and 5 µg/ml (2.9 µM) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. The peptides Undeca 6 (YRAWRWAWRWR-NH2) and Undeca 7 (YRMWRWAWRWR-NH2) were the two most active undecapeptides against Staphylococcus aureus, both displaying a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2.5 µg/ml (1.5 µM). The study showed that a level was reached in which undecapeptides having a net charge above +4 and containing three or four Trp residues all displayed a high antibacterial activity. All undecapeptides prepared were essentially non-haemolytic, but undecapeptides containing more than three Trp residues displayed 50% haemolysis of human red blood cells at concentrations above 400 µg/ml (>230 µM).

FKCRRWQWRM	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-45	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	C. albicans		A novel bovine lactoferrin peptide, FKCRRWQWRM, suppresses Candidacell growth and activates neutrophils	Ueta, E. et al.	To identify potent new antifungal agents, the Candida cell growth inhibitory activities of six lactoferrin (Lf) peptides consisting of 6–25 amino acid residues (peptide 1, FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF = lactoferricin B; peptide 2, FKCRRWQWRM; peptide 2′, FKARRWQWRM; peptide 3, GAPSITCVRRAF; peptide 4, RRWQWR; and peptide 5, RWQWRM) were examined. Of these, peptide 2 strongly suppressed the multiplication of Candida cells, but other peptides showed only weak activities. In two strains of C. albicans, the minimum inhibitory concentration 100 of peptide 2 (17.3 ± 2.2 µm and 17.5 ± 2.4 µm) was close to that of miconazole (13.0 ± 1.7 µm and 13.1 ± 1.6 µm) but markedly different from that of amphotericin B (0.52 ± 0.09 µm and 0.56 ± 0.11 µm). The suppression of Candida cell growth was additively increased by a combination of peptide 2 with amphotericin B and miconazole. Peptides 1, 3, 4 and 5 and Lf suppressed iron uptake by Candida cells, inversely correlated with their Candida cell growth inhibition activities. However, iron uptake was not inhibited by peptide 2. In addition, peptide 2 upregulated Candida cell killing activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) increasing their superoxide generation, protein kinase C activity, p38 MAPK activity and the expression of p47phox. These results indicated that the main antimicrobial activity of the Lf peptides is dependent on the N-terminal half of Lf and that the PMN upregulatory activity of peptide 2 and additive function of peptide 2 with antifungal drugs are useful for prophylaxis and control of candidiasis.	10.1111/j.1399-3011.2001.00821.x

Subfragments of lactoferricin were isolated from reduced and cleaved peptide by reverse-phase HPLC. Subfragment 1 (residues 1 to 10) was active against most of the test microorganisms at concentrations of 10 to 50 microM. Subfragment 2 (residues 11 to 26) was active against only a few microorganisms at concentrations up to 100 microM. These antibacterial studies indicate that the activity of lactoferricin is mainly, but not wholly, due to its N-terminal region.	10.1128/aac.41.1.54
FFSASCVPGADKGQFPNLCRLCAGTGENKCA	P02788	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	171-201	Antimicrobial				Antibacterial, Antifungal		Different anti-Candida activities of two human lactoferrin-derived peptides, Lfpep and kaliocin-1	Viejo-Diaz, M. et al.	The synthetic peptides Lfpep and kaliocin-1 include the sequences from positions 18 to 40 and 153 to 183 of human lactoferrin, respectively. Lfpep is a cationic peptide with bactericidal and giardicidal effects, whereas kaliocin-1 is a novel bactericidal peptide that corresponds to a highly homologous sequence present in the transferrin family of proteins. Both peptides presented fungicidal activity against Candida spp., including fluconazole- and amphotericin B-resistant clinical isolates. Lfpep exhibited higher antifungal activity (8- to 30-fold) and salt resistance than kaliocin-1. The killing activity of Lfpep was mediated by its permeabilizing activity on Candida albicans cells, whereas kaliocin-1 was unable to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, as indicated by its inability to allow permeation of propidium iodide and the small amount of K+ released. The amino acid sequence of kaliocin-1 includes the “multidimensional antimicrobial signature” conserved in disulfide-containing antimicrobial peptides and a striking similarity to brevinin-1Sa, an antimicrobial peptide from frog skin secretions, exhibiting a “Rana box”-like sequence. These features may be of interest in the design of new antifungals.	10.1128/AAC.49.7.2583-2588.2005
EDLIWKLLSKAQEKFGKNKSR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	283-303	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	C. albicans		Lactoferrampin, an antimicrobial peptide of bovine lactoferrin, exerts its candidacidal activity by a cluster of positively charged residues at the C-terminus in combination with a helix-facilitating N-terminal part	Van Der Kraan, MIA. et al.	The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is attributed to lactoferricin, which is situated in the N1-domain of bLF. Recently, another antimicrobial domain consisting of residues 268–284, designated lactoferrampin (LFampin), has been identified in the N1-domain of bLF, which exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and several bacteria. In the present study, the candidacidal activity of a series of peptides spanning this antimicrobial domain was investigated in relation to the charge and the capacity to form a helical conformation in hydrophobic environments. C-Terminal truncation of LFampin resulted in a drastic decrease in candidacidal activity. Positively charged residues clustered at the C-terminal side of the LFampin domain appeared to be crucial for the candidacidal activity. The ability to adopt helical conformations did not change when LFampin was truncated at the C-terminal side. N-Terminally truncated LFampin peptides, truncated up to the sequence 270–284, were more reluctant to adopt a helical conformation. Therefore, we conclude that the C-terminal part of LFampin 265–284, which is the most active peptide, is crucial for its candidacidal activity, due to the presence of clustered positive charges, and that the N-terminal part is essential for activity as it facilitates helix formation.	10.1515/BC.2005.017
EDLIWK	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	283-288	Antimicrobial				Antiviral HSV-1		Bovine Lactoferrin Peptidic Fragments Involved in Inhibition of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Infection	Siciliano, R. et al.	Bovine lactoferrin (BLf) prevents the infection of some enveloped and naked viruses. To identify BLf sequences responsible for the antiviral activity, we tested 31 HPLC fractions, derived from tryptic digestion of BLf, toward herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Only a few HPLC purified fragments were active against HSV-1, even if at lower extent than the native undigested BLf. Two large fragments, one corresponding to the C-lobe (amino acid sequence 345–689) and the other corresponding to a large portion of the N-lobe (1–280), were inhibitors of HSV-1 infection, while a smaller part of the N-lobe (86–258) was ineffective. Among the low-molecular-weight fragments, only two small peptides, which coeluted in a single chromatographic peak, were effective towards HSV-1. These peptides, both present in the N-lobe, were identified as peptides 222–230 (ADRDQYELL) and 264–269 (EDLIWK). The same peptides, chemically synthesised, were able to inhibit HSV-1 infection only when they were assayed in association.	10.1006/bbrc.1999.1318

There is a need for new microbicidal agents with therapeutic potential due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria and fungi. In this study, the structure-microbicidal activity relationship of amino acid residues 14 to 31 (sequence 14-31) from the N-terminal end, corresponding to the antibacterial α-helix of human lactoferrin (LF), was investigated by downsizing, alanine scanning, and substitution of amino acids. Microbicidal analysis (99% killing) was performed by a microplate assay using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans as test organisms. Starting from the N-terminal end, downsizing of peptide sequence 14-31 showed that the peptide sequence 19-31 (KCFQWQRNMRKVR, HL9) was the optimal length for antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, HL9 bound to lipid A/lipopolysaccharide, as shown by neutralizing endotoxic activity in a Limulus assay. Alanine scanning of peptide sequence 20-31 showed that Cys20, Trp23, Arg28, Lys29, or Arg31 was important for expressing full killing activity, particularly against C. albicans. Substituting the neutral hydrophilic amino acids Gln24 and Asn26 for Lys and Ala (HLopt2), respectively, enhanced microbicidal activity significantly against all test organisms compared to the amino acids natural counterpart, also, in comparison with HL9, HLopt2 had more than 10-fold-stronger fungicidal activity. Furthermore, HLopt2 was less affected by metallic salts than HL9. The microbicidal activity of HLopt2 was slightly reduced only at pH 7.0, as tested in the pH range of 4.5 to 7.5. The results showed that the microbicidal activity of synthetic peptide sequences, based on the antimicrobial α-helix region of LF, can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the length and substitution of neutral amino acids at specific positions, thus suggesting a sequence lead with therapeutic potential.	10.1128/AAC.00908-09

Antimicrobial peptides have been found throughout living nature, yet antimicrobial sequences may still lie hidden within a wide variety of proteins. A rational strategy was developed to select interesting domains, based on the presumed common features of antimicrobial peptides, and to release these from accessible and safe proteins. In silico proteolysis simulations of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) with selected endoproteinases predicted the liberation of peptides that encompasses a cationic amphipathic α-helix. Three predicted peptides were synthesized and tested for their biological activity, demonstrating that one single enzyme was sufficient to obtain an antimicrobial peptide. The proof of principle demonstrated that a 32-mer fragment isolated from the endoproteinase AspN digestion of bLF possessed strong antimicrobial activity. Moreover, desalted crude digest had improved activity over native bLF. Hence, selective digestion of bLF Increase its antimicrobial activity by release of antimicrobial stretches.	10.1016/j.peptides.2005.06.012

Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, searching for new antimicrobial agents is an urgent need. In this study, in vitro antibacterial and antimicrobial effects of milk-derived antimicrobial agents, lactoferrin-derived peptides, lactoferricin (Lfc) and lactoferrampin (Lfa) (alone or in combination) and their association with natural extracts have been explored. The assessment of antimicrobial activity was based on two measurements: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Fractional Inhibitory Concentration indexes. Lfc alone is more suitable for inhibiting Staphylococcus intermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis, while Lfa against Candida albicans, a synergistic effect of the two peptides against all the three pathogens has been detected. A strong synergy of all the natural extracts with Lfc and Lfa solution against selected microorganisms in vitro was pointed out. Our results suggest that natural-derived compounds, such as milk peptides and vegetal extracts could be promising tools to treat moderate fungal and bacterial infections.	10.1080/14786419.2020.1821017

DLIWKLLSKAQEKFGKNKSR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	284-303	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli C. albicans S. sanguinis		Novel lactoferrampin antimicrobial peptides derived from human lactoferrin	Haney, EF. et al.	Human lactoferrampin is a novel antimicrobial peptide found in the cationic N-terminal lobe of the iron-binding human lactoferrin protein. The amino acid sequence that directly corresponds to the previously characterized bovine lactoferrin-derived lactoferrampin peptide is inactive on its own (WNLLRQAQEKFGKDKSP, residues 269–285). However, by increasing the net positive charge near the C-terminal end of human lactoferrampin, a significant increase in its antibacterial and Candidacidal activity was obtained. Conversely, the addition of an N-terminal helix cap (sequence DAI) did not have any appreciable effect on the antibacterial or antifungal activity of human lactoferrampin peptides, even though it markedly influenced that of bovine lactoferrampin. The solution structure of five human lactoferrampin variants was determined in SDS micelles and all of the structures display a well-defined amphipathic N-terminal helix and a flexible cationic C-terminus. Differential scanning calorimetry studies indicate that this peptide is capable of inserting into the hydrophobic core of a membrane, while fluorescence spectroscopy results suggest that a hydrophobic patch encompassing the single Trp and Phe residues as well as Leu, Ile and Ala side chains mediates the interaction between the peptide and the hydrophobic core of a phospholipid bilayer.	10.1016/j.biochi.2008.04.013
DLIWKLLSKAQEKFGKNKSR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	284-303	Antimicrobial			MIC	C. albicans		Lactoferrampin, an antimicrobial peptide of bovine lactoferrin, exerts its candidacidal activity by a cluster of positively charged residues at the C-terminus in combination with a helix-facilitating N-terminal part	Van Der Kraan, MIA. et al.	The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is attributed to lactoferricin, which is situated in the N1-domain of bLF. Recently, another antimicrobial domain consisting of residues 268–284, designated lactoferrampin (LFampin), has been identified in the N1-domain of bLF, which exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and several bacteria. In the present study, the candidacidal activity of a series of peptides spanning this antimicrobial domain was investigated in relation to the charge and the capacity to form a helical conformation in hydrophobic environments. C-Terminal truncation of LFampin resulted in a drastic decrease in candidacidal activity. Positively charged residues clustered at the C-terminal side of the LFampin domain appeared to be crucial for the candidacidal activity. The ability to adopt helical conformations did not change when LFampin was truncated at the C-terminal side. N-Terminally truncated LFampin peptides, truncated up to the sequence 270–284, were more reluctant to adopt a helical conformation. Therefore, we conclude that the C-terminal part of LFampin 265–284, which is the most active peptide, is crucial for its candidacidal activity, due to the presence of clustered positive charges, and that the N-terminal part is essential for activity as it facilitates helix formation.	10.1515/BC.2005.017

The intent of this study was to examine human and bovine lactoferrin fragments including lactoferrin (1-11), lactoferricin and lactoferrampin, all of which did not demonstrate hemolytic activity toward rabbit erythrocytes at 1 mM concentration, for possible inhibitory effects on the activities of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase. The data showed that human lactoferricin was the most potent in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (IC50 =2 μM). Bovine lactoferricin (IC50 = 10 μM) and bovine lactoferrampin (IC50 = 150 μM) were less potent. Human lactoferrampin and human and bovine lactoferrin (1-11) at 1 mM concentration did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. All peptides showed only a slight inhibitory effect (from slightly below 2% to 6% inhibition) on HIV-1 protease. Human lactoferrampin and bovine lactoferrampin showed obvious inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase at 37 μM and 18.5 μM, respectively. The HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity of human lactoferrampin and bovine lactoferrampin was dose-dependent. The other peptides were devoid of HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity. Thus, it is concluded that some lactoferrin fragments exert an inhibitory action on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 integrase.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.07.006

Two antimicrobial cryptopeptides from the N1 domain of bovine lactoferrin, lactoferricin (LFcin17–30) and lactoferrampin (LFampin265–284), together with a hybrid version (LFchimera), were tested against the protozoan parasite Leishmania. All peptides were leishmanicidal against Leishmania donovani promastigotes, and LFchimera showed a significantly higher activity over its two composing moieties. Besides, it was the only peptide active on Leishmania pifanoi axenic amastigotes, already showing activity below 10 μM. To investigate their leishmanicidal mechanism, promastigote membrane permeabilization was assessed by decrease of free ATP levels in living parasites, entrance of the vital dye SYTOX Green (MW = 600 Da) and confocal and transmission electron microscopy. The peptides induced plasma membrane permeabilization and bioenergetic collapse of the parasites. To further clarify the structural traits underlying the increased leishmanicidal activity of LFchimera, the activity of several analogues was assessed. Results revealed that the high activity of these hybrid peptides seems to be related to the order and sequence orientation of the two cryptopeptide moieties, rather than to their particular linkage through an additional lysine, as in the initial LFchimera. The incorporation of both antimicrobial cryptopeptide motifs into a single linear sequence facilitates chemical synthesis and should help in the potential clinical application of these optimized analogues.	10.1007/s00726-012-1304-0

The investigation of the recombinant bovine lactoferrin-derived antimicrobial protein (rBLfA) demonstrates that the inter-lobe region of bovine lactoferrin contributes to iron binding stability and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. rBLfA containing N-lobe (amino acid residues 1–333) and inter-lobe region (residues 334–344) was expressed in Pichia pastoris at shaking flask and fermentor level. The recombinant intact bovine lactoferrin (rBLf) and N-lobe (rBLfN) were expressed in the same system as control. The physical–chemical parameters of rBLfA, rBLfN and rBLf including amino acid residues, molecular weight, isoelectric point, net positive charge and instability index were computed and compared. The simulated tertiary structure and the calculated surface net charge showed that rBLfA maintained original structure and exhibited a higher cationic feature than rBLf and rBLfN. The three proteins showed different iron binding stability and antimicrobial activity. rBLfA released iron in the pH range of 7.0–3.5, whereas rBLfN lost its iron over the pH range of 7.0–4.0 and iron release from rBLf occurred in the pH range of 5.5–3.0. However, the minimum inhibition concentration of rBLfA against S. aureus ATCC25923 was 6.5 μmol/L, compared with 12.5 and 25 μmol/L that of rBLfN and rBLf, respectively. These results revealed that S. aureus was more sensitive to rBLfA than rBLfN and rBLf.

The investigation of the recombinant bovine lactoferrin-derived antimicrobial protein (rBLfA) demonstrates that the inter-lobe region of bovine lactoferrin contributes to iron binding stability and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. rBLfA containing N-lobe (amino acid residues 1–333) and inter-lobe region (residues 334–344) was expressed in Pichia pastoris at shaking flask and fermentor level. The recombinant intact bovine lactoferrin (rBLf) and N-lobe (rBLfN) were expressed in the same system as control. The physical–chemical parameters of rBLfA, rBLfN and rBLf including amino acid residues, molecular weight, isoelectric point, net positive charge and instability index were computed and compared. The simulated tertiary structure and the calculated surface net charge showed that rBLfA maintained original structure and exhibited a higher cationic feature than rBLf and rBLfN. The three proteins showed different iron binding stability and antimicrobial activity. rBLfA released iron in the pH range of 7.0–3.5, whereas rBLfN lost its iron over the pH range of 7.0–4.0 and iron release from rBLf occurred in the pH range of 5.5–3.0. However, the minimum inhibition concentration of rBLfA against S. aureus ATCC25923 was 6.5 μmol/L, compared with 12.5 and 25 μmol/L that of rBLfN and rBLf, respectively. These results revealed that S. aureus was more sensitive to rBLfA than rBLfN and rBLf. It appeared that the strong cationic character of inter-lobe region related positively to the higher anti-S. aureus activity.	10.1007/s10534-010-9300-x
APRKNVRWCTISQPEWFKCR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	20-39	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli B. subtilis		Novel antibacterial lactoferrin peptides generated by rennet digestion and autofocusing technique	Elbarbary, H. et al.	Bovine lactoferrin was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including calf rennet, fungal rennin, and porcine pepsin. Lactoferrin hydrolysates were assessed for their antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. At pH 3, calf rennet lactoferrin hydrolysate before (LFH) showed the highest antimicrobial activity, then pepsin LFH, while fungal rennin LFH was the least active. The calf rennet and pepsin LFH were fractionated using autofocusing and chromatographic techniques. The activity-guided fractionation of calf rennet LFH identified a potent antimicrobial peptide of 11-residues, lactoferricin B (Lf-cin B), and three other novel antibacterial peptides. The 11-residues Lf-cin B was the most potent antibacterial peptide and was isolated from both rennet and pepsin LFH. Pepsin LFH had a main antimicrobial peptide of 25-residues, which was not detected in calf rennet LFH. It could be concluded that calf rennet LFH had stronger antibacterial properties than porcine pepsin LFH. Besides, autofocusing could be used for scaling up the isolation of the potent rennet LFH peptides that would have a widespread commercial use as a natural food preservative substituting porcine pepsin digest, especially in Islamic communities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.12.019
APRKNVRWCTI	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	20-30	Antimicrobial	HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase-inhibitory					A study of effects of peptide fragments of bovine and human lactoferrins on activities of three key HIV-1 enzymes	Wong, JH. et al.	The intent of this study was to examine human and bovine lactoferrin fragments including lactoferrin (1-11), lactoferricin and lactoferrampin, all of which did not demonstrate hemolytic activity toward rabbit erythrocytes at 1 mM concentration, for possible inhibitory effects on the activities of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase. The data showed that human lactoferricin was the most potent in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (IC50 =2 μM). Bovine lactoferricin (IC50 = 10 μM) and bovine lactoferrampin (IC50 = 150 μM) were less potent. Human lactoferrampin and human and bovine lactoferrin (1-11) at 1 mM concentration did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. All peptides showed only a slight inhibitory effect (from slightly below 2% to 6% inhibition) on HIV-1 protease. Human lactoferrampin and bovine lactoferrampin showed obvious inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase at 37 μM and 18.5 μM, respectively. The HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity of human lactoferrampin and bovine lactoferrampin was dose-dependent. The other peptides were devoid of HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity. Thus, it is concluded that some lactoferrin fragments exert an inhibitory action on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 integrase.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.07.006
ADRDQYELL	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	241-249	Antimicrobial				Antiviral HSV-1		Bovine Lactoferrin Peptidic Fragments Involved in Inhibition of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Infection	Siciliano, R. et al.	Bovine lactoferrin (BLf) prevents the infection of some enveloped and naked viruses. To identify BLf sequences responsible for the antiviral activity, we tested 31 HPLC fractions, derived from tryptic digestion of BLf, toward herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Only a few HPLC purified fragments were active against HSV-1, even if at lower extent than the native undigested BLf. Two large fragments, one corresponding to the C-lobe (amino acid sequence 345–689) and the other corresponding to a large portion of the N-lobe (1–280), were inhibitors of HSV-1 infection, while a smaller part of the N-lobe (86–258) was ineffective. Among the low-molecular-weight fragments, only two small peptides, which coeluted in a single chromatographic peak, were effective towards HSV-1. These peptides, both present in the N-lobe, were identified as peptides 222–230 (ADRDQYELL) and 264–269 (EDLIWK). The same peptides, chemically synthesised, were able to inhibit HSV-1 infection only when they were assayed in association.	10.1006/bbrc.1999.1318
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-57	Anticancer	Inhibits angiogenesis					Bovine Lactoferricin Inhibits Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor165-Induced Angiogenesis by Competing for Heparin-Like Binding Sites on Endothelial Cells	Mader, J. et al.	Angiogenesis is a complex process whereby new blood vessels form from pre-existing vasculature in response to proangiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the 165-kd isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165). Angiogenesis inhibitors show considerable potential in the treatment of cancer because angiogenesis is necessary for tumor growth beyond a few millimeters in diameter because of the tumor's need for oxygen and nutrient supply, as well as waste removal. Bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB) is a peptide fragment of iron- and heparin-binding lactoferrin obtained from cow's milk. Here we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that LfcinB has potent antiangiogenic activity. LfcinB strongly inhibited both bFGF- and VEGF165-induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs implanted in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, LfcinB inhibited the in vitro proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in response to bFGF or VEGF165 but was not cytotoxic to HUVECs. Rather, LfcinB complexed with heparin-like structures on the HUVEC surface that are involved in the binding of bFGF and VEGF165 to their respective receptors, thereby preventing receptor-stimulated angiogenesis. These findings suggest that LfcinB may have utility as an antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of human cancers.	10.2353/ajpath.2006.051229
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-57	Anticancer	Cytotoxic for neuroblastoma cell lines					The antimicrobial peptide, lactoferricin B, is cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and inhibits xenograft growth in vivo	Eliassen, Liv. et al.	Antimicrobial peptides have been shown to exert cytotoxic activity towards cancer cells through their ability to interact with negatively charged cell membranes. In this study the cytotoxic effect of the antimicrobial peptide, LfcinB was tested in a panel of human neuroblastoma cell lines. LfcinB displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against both MYCN-amplified and non-MYCN-amplified cell lines. Non-transformed fibroblasts were not substantially affected by LfcinB. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with LfcinB induced rapid destabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane and formation of membrane blebs. Depolarization of the mitochondria membranes and irreversible changes in the mitochondria morphology was also evident. Immuno- and fluorescence-labeled LfcinB revealed that the peptide co-localized with mitochondria. Furthermore, treatment of neuroblastoma cells with LfcinB induced cleavage of caspase-6, -7 and -9 followed by cell death. However, neither addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, or specific caspase inhibitors could reverse the cytotoxic effect induced by LfcinB. Treatment of established SH-SY-5Y neuroblastoma xenografts with repeated injections of LfcinB resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition. These results revealed a selective destabilizing effect of LfcinB on two important targets in the neuroblastoma cells, the cytoplasmic- and the mitochondria membrane. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	10.1002/ijc.21886
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-57	Anticancer	Cytotoxic for Jurkat leukemia cells					Bovine lactoferricin causes apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells by sequential permeabilization of the cell membrane and targeting of mitochondria	Mader, J. et al.	Bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide that kills Jurkat T-leukemia cells by the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. However, the process by which LfcinB triggers mitochondria-dependent apoptosis is not well understood. Here, we show that LfcinB-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells was preceded by LfcinB binding to, and progressive permeabilization of the cell membrane. Colloidal gold electron microscopy revealed that LfcinB entered the cytoplasm of Jurkat T-leukemia cells prior to the onset of mitochondrial depolarization. LfcinB was not internalized by endocytosis because endocytosis inhibitors did not prevent LfcinB-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, intracellular delivery of LfcinB via fusogenic liposomes caused the death of Jurkat T-leukemia cells, as well as normal human fibroblasts. Collectively, these findings suggest that LfcinB caused damage to the cell membrane that allowed LfcinB to enter the cytoplasm of Jurkat T-leukemia cells and mediate cytotoxicity. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that intracellular LfcinB co-localized with mitochondria in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, while flow cytometry and colloidal gold electron microscopy showed that LfcinB rapidly associated with purified mitochondria. Furthermore, purified mitochondria treated with LfcinB rapidly lost transmembrane potential and released cytochrome c. We conclude that LfcinB-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells resulted from cell membrane damage and the subsequent disruption of mitochondrial membranes by internalized LfcinB.	10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.05.015
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-57	Anticancer	Cytoxic for MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells					Lactoferricin-induced apoptosis in estrogen-nonresponsive MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells is enhanced by C6 ceramide or tamoxifen	Furlong, S. et al.	Bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB) is a cationic peptide that selectively induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia and carcinoma cell lines. Ceramide is a second messenger in apoptosis signaling that has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of various anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we determined whether manipulation of intracellular ceramide levels enhanced LfcinB-induced apoptosis of estrogen-nonresponsive MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells. LfcinB caused DNA fragmentation and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell cultures, but did not affect the viability of untransformed mammary epithelial cells. MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells also exhibited DNA fragmentation and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis following exposure to the cell-permeable ceramide analog C6. An additive increase in DNA fragmentation was observed when both LfcinB and C6 ceramide were added to MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell cultures. A greater than additive increase in DNA fragmentation was seen when LfcinB was used in combination with tamoxifen, which prevents the metabolism of endogenous ceramide to glucosylceramide by glucosylceramide synthase, as well as blocking estrogen receptor signaling. However, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase,1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, failed to further increase DNA fragmentation by LfcinB, suggesting that tamoxifen enhanced LfcinB-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells via a mechanism that did not involve glucosylceramide synthase inhibition. We conclude that combination therapy with LfcinB and tamoxifen warrants further investigation for possible use in the treatment of breast cancer.	10.3892/or.15.5.1385
FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	36-57	Anticancer	Cytotoxic for leukemic cells			Antiviral HSV-1		Peptides From the N-terminal End of Bovine Lactoferrin Induce Apoptosis in Human Leukemic (HL-60) Cells	Roy, M K. et al.	To determine the effects of the multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin (LF) and related compounds on the growth of leukemic cells, human myeloid leukemic cells (HL-60) were exposed to bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and proteolytic hydrolysates of bLF. Pepsin hydrolysates of bLF showed a greater growth suppressive effect than tryptic hydrolysates or mature bLF. Four peptides with proliferation inhibition activity were purified from pepsin hydrolysates by ion-exchange chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, and gel-filtration. All peptides were from the N-terminal end, in a region where lactoferricin B (Lfcin B), an antibacterial peptide, is located. Among the four peptides, peptide 1 (pep1) was found to exhibit highest activity and corresponded to residues 17 to 38 of bLF, with a molecular weight of 2753.88. The IC50 value of this peptide was 6.3 μg/ml. Three other peptides were less active and corresponded to sequences 1 to 16 and 45 to 48, linked by disulfide-bridge (pep2, molecular mass of 2430.13), 1 to 15 and 45 to 46 linked by disulfide bridge (pep3, molecular mass of 2017,92) and from residues 1 to 13 (pep4, molecular mass of 1558.73). Cell proliferation inhibition activity of the peptides was thought to be due to induction of apoptosis, which was evaluated by DNA ladder formation, DNA fragmentation, enhanced expression of phosphatidyl serine, and morphological changes. The IC50 values of the three peptides were confirmed using synthetic peptides and were consistent with those of purified peptides.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74284-7
YKLRP	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	91-95	ACE-inhibitory		16.5				Novel Antihypertensive Lactoferrin-Derived Peptides Produced by Kluyveromyces marxianus: Gastrointestinal Stability Profile and In Vivo Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibition	Garcia-Tejedor, A. et al.	Novel antihypertensive peptides released by Kluyveromyces marxianus from bovine lactoferrin (LF) have been identified. K. marxianus LF permeate was fractionated by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography and 35 peptides contained in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory fractions were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. On the basis of peptide abundance and common structural features, six peptides were chemically synthesized. Four of them (DPYKLRP, PYKLRP, YKLRP, and GILRP) exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity and effectively decreased systolic blood pressure after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Stability against gastrointestinal enzymes suggested that the sequence LRP could contribute to the in vivo effects of parental peptides. Finally, there were reductions in circulating ACE activity and angiotensin II level in SHRs after either DPYKLRP or LRP intake, thus confirming ACE inhibition as the in vivo mechanism for their antihypertensive effect.	10.1021/jf4053868
RRWQWR	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	39-44	ACE-inhibitory		32.0				Antihypertensive Properties of Lactoferricin B-Derived Peptides	Ruiz-Gimenez, P. et al.	A set of eight lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-derived peptides was examined for inhibitory effects on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and ACE-dependent vasoconstriction, and their hypotensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Peptides were derived from different elongations both at the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the representative peptide LfcinB20−25, which is known as the LfcinB antimicrobial core. All of the eight LfcinB-derived peptides showed in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity with different IC50 values. Moreover, seven of them showed ex vivo inhibitory effects on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. No clear correlation between in vitro and ex vivo inhibitory effects was found. Only LfcinB20−25 and one of its fragments, F1, generated after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion, showed significant antihypertensive effects in SHR after oral administration. Remarkably, F1 did not show any effect on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction in contrast to the inhibitory effect showed by LfcinB20−25. In conclusion, two LfcinB-derived peptides lower blood pressure and exhibit potential as orally effective antihypertensive compounds, yet a complete elucidation of the mechanism(s) involved deserves further ongoing research.	10.1021/jf100899u

The potential of bovine lactoferrin (LF) as a source of antihypertensive peptides has been examined. For this purpose, LF pepsin hydrolysate with molecular mass lower than 3 kDa (LFH < 3 kDa) was prepared and orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), resulting in reduced systolic blood pressure in a significant and maintained manner up to 24 h after administration. LFH < 3 kDa was further fractionated by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 38 peptides, contained in the active fractions, were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Based on the peptide abundance, a total of 11 peptides were chemically synthesized and their ACE inhibitory activity tested. Only three of them, corresponding to peptides of sequences LIWKL, RPYL and LNNSRAP exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.47, 56.5 and 105.3 μM, respectively. The three peptides also showed antihypertensive effects in SHR and remarkably the effect of LIWKL remained significant for up to 24 h post-administration, similarly LFH < 3 kDa and the captopril control. The two most potent in vitro inhibitory peptides showed ex vivo inhibitory effect on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction as well. In conclusion, three novel LF-derived peptides and a pepsin LFH < 3 kDa lowered blood pressure and exhibit potential as orally effective antihypertensive compounds.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.076

The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.	10.1080/1475636031000138723
LRPVAA	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	93-98	ACE-inhibitory		4.14				The Antihypertensive Activity of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptide Containing in Bovine Lactoferrin	Lee, N-Y. et al.	Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide was isolated from the bovine lactoferrin hydrolysate using peptic hydrolysis by 2-step of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. This peptide was identified as Leu-Arg-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala and it produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ACE activity in vitro with an IC50 value of about 4.14 microM. Also, this inhibition was identified as noncompetitive from the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Moreover, the antihypertensive activity of Leu-Arg-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala was investigated by the intravenous injection into spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). A dose-dependent reduction of systolic blood pressure by this peptide was observed at 60 min after injection and it maximally decreased the blood pressure at a rate of 1 nmol/ml/kg. The blood pressure lowering activity of this peptide was calculated as 210% of captopril (10 pmol/ml/kg) that was used as positive control. Otherwise, identification of this peptide in the blood of SHRs was carried out chromatographically. Reduction of blood pressure coincides with the peak peptide concentration in the serum. Thus, we conclude that this peptide inhibits ACE activity in vitro and lowers systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rat.	PMID: 16830788

Moreover, seven of them showed ex vivo inhibitory effects on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. No clear correlation between in vitro and ex vivo inhibitory effects was found. Only LfcinB20−25 and one of its fragments, F1, generated after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion, showed significant antihypertensive effects in SHR after oral administration. Remarkably, F1 did not show any effect on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction in contrast to the inhibitory effect showed by LfcinB20−25. In conclusion, two LfcinB-derived peptides lower blood pressure and exhibit potential as orally effective antihypertensive compounds, yet a complete elucidation of the mechanism(s) involved deserves further ongoing research.	10.1021/jf100899u

Novel antihypertensive peptides released by Kluyveromyces marxianus from bovine lactoferrin (LF) have been identified. K. marxianus LF permeate was fractionated by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography and 35 peptides contained in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory fractions were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. On the basis of peptide abundance and common structural features, six peptides were chemically synthesized. Four of them (DPYKLRP, PYKLRP, YKLRP, and GILRP) exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity and effectively decreased systolic blood pressure after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Stability against gastrointestinal enzymes suggested that the sequence LRP could contribute to the in vivo effects of parental peptides. Finally, there were reductions in circulating ACE activity and angiotensin II level in SHRs after either DPYKLRP or LRP intake, thus confirming ACE inhibition as the in vivo mechanism for their antihypertensive effect.	10.1021/jf4053868

The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins.

Lactoferricins are positively charged, highly basic peptides that are generated upon gastric pepsin cleavage of various lactoferrins. In the past decade, there has been active investigation of the key antimicrobial segments of the various shorter synthetic bovine and human lactoferricins, but not in porcine lactoferricin. These studies have demonstrated the distinct solution structures of lactoferricin in bovine and human and established the multifunctional nature of the antibacterial, antifungal, antiendotoxin, and antiviral activities of lactoferricins. However, the protective effects of porcine lactoferricins have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, a series of synthetic derivatives of porcine, bovine, and human lactoferricins with 20-residue and 9-residue peptides were prepared to investigate their antimicrobial nature. We found that the 20-residue porcine lactoferricin (LFcin P-20) displayed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, and Candida albicans ATCC14053. The minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of LFcin P-20 ranged from 12 to 25 μM when tested in bacteria and fungi.

FKSETKNLL	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	651-659	Osteoanabolic						A bovine lactoferrin derived peptide induced osteogenesis via regulation of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation	Shi, P. et al.	Osteoporosis is a disease of aging, characterized by a decrease in bone quality and a reduction in bone strength. Promoting the activity of osteoblasts is a useful strategy for combating the progression of osteoporosis. As a novel bone growth factor, lactoferrin plays a role in the anabolic activity in bone by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and inhibiting the formation of osteoclasts. However, potential peptides with osteogenic activity from lactoferrin have not been identified. In the present study, a peptide with osteogenic activity—LFP-C, fragment residues 624 to 632, derived from lactoferrin hydrolysates—was identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and screened using molecular docking analysis. The LFP-C peptide significantly increased the proliferation of mouse cell line MC3T3-E1 and had a promoting effect on alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. Moreover, LFP-C increased the proportion of osteoblasts in the G2 and M phases. The osteogenic mechanism of LFP-C was also studied by molecular docking. We found that LFP-C could bind to the key domain (Lys13-Thr15-Gln16-Leu17-Gly18-Asp22) of epidermal growth factor receptor, a vital receptor tyrosine kinase that leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The main interaction forces were interpolated charge, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bonding. Results indicated that LFP-C may play an osteogenic role in a similar way to lactoferrin, by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. The findings of this in vitro experiment also demonstrated that the molecular docking method could play a role in the screening process; this in silico approach allowed for faster and cheaper identification of a promising bioactive component.	10.3168/jds.2019-17425
KCRQWQSKIRRTNPMFCIRR	P14632	Lactotransferrin	Sus scrofa	37-56	Immunomodulatory						Porcine lactoferrin derived peptide LFP-20 modulates immune homoeostasis	Zong, X. et al.	The performance of immune system is vital for defending the body from pathogens, and it plays a crucial role in health homoeostasis. In a previous study, we have shown that LFP-20, a twenty-amino acid antimicrobial peptide in the N terminus of porcine lactoferrin, modulated inflammatory response in colitis. Here, we further investigated the effects of LFP-20 on immune homoeostasis to elucidate the mechanism of its anti-inflammation action. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered systemic inflammatory response mice model was established. On the basis of observed mucosal lesions and apoptosis in small intestine, we found increased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in ileum after LPS stimulation. Expectedly, LFP-20 pre-treatment attenuated the LPS-mediated immune disorders in ileum. Moreover, the flow cytometry results indicated pre-treatment with LFP-20 sustained the balance of CD3+CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer cells in LPS-triggered immune disturbance. Simultaneously, we demonstrated LFP-20 modulated the secretion of both activated Th1-related IL-12p70, interferon-γ, TNF-α and Th2-related IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6. Furthermore, we found LFP-20 facilitated a balanced Th1 and Th2 response, which triggered cellular defence mechanisms and induced B cells to produce opsonising antibodies belonging to certain IgG subclasses to defend against LPS stimulation. Collectively, our study indicated pre-treatment with LFP-20 could defend against LPS-triggered systemic inflammatory response in mice via modulating immune homoeostasis.	10.1017/S0007114519000485

"Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lifestyle-related diseases. Lactoferrin antioxidant peptide
sequence SVDGKEDLIW has been purified from buffalo milk protein and then synthesized by solid phase synthesis.
The antioxidant activity of the synthetic peptide was evaluated in D-Galactose treated Kunming mice. The experiment
design included 35 mice that randomly divided into 5 groups named, normal group, G-Galatose model group, D-
Galactose + low dose of synthetic peptide (0.1 g/kg body weight), D-Galactose + high dose of synthetic peptide (0.6g/kg
body weight) and D- Galctose + vitamin C. After 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the activities of superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in blood, heart, liver and brain of
mice were measured. The mice group of high-dose peptide showed significantly (P<0.01) higher liver index (5.89) than
that of D-Galactose model group (4.41). The highest SOD activity values of heart, liver, brain and blood were obtained
in low-dose synthetic peptide group (212.33, 404.88, 296.26 “U/mg protein” and 28.15 “U/g protein”, respectively).
Similarly, low-dose synthetic peptide group showed significantly (P<0.05) higher values of GSH-PX activity. Whereas,
MDA contents in heart and whole blood (0.35 and 25.24 “nmol/mg protein”, respectively) were significantly (P<0.05)
decreased in the low-dose peptide group. This study emphasizes the antioxidant activity of SVDGKEDLIW in vivo and
demonstrates a promising antioxidant capacity of the synthetic peptide derived from lactoferrin of buffalo milk."	10.36899/JAPS.2020.1.0008
NLPEKADRD	P24627	Lactotransferrin	Bos taurus	236-244	ACE-inhibitory						Identification  of  dual-function  bovine  lactoferrin  peptides  released  using  simulated  gastrointestinal  digestion.  	Tu, M.  et al.	Lactoferrin (LF) is a good protein for producing various bioactive peptides, such as those with antimicrobial, immunomodulating, and antihypertensive activities. However, there is no report about a peptide from lactoferrin with both angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) and anticoagulant activities. This study investigated the ACEI and anticoagulant activities of the lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) produced using simulated gastrointestinal digestion and identified the potential peptide with both activities, as well as studied its active mechanisms. Results indicated that the LFH showed ACEI activity with an IC50 value of 0.38 ± 0.06 mg mL−1. Moreover, LFH showed its anticoagulant activity by prolonging the thrombin time from 13.1 ± 0.1 to 20.9 ± 0.5 s at 20 mg mL−1. Nano-scale liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis showed that a total of 73 peptides with 7–21 amino acid residues were identified from LFH. The peptide ENLPEKADRD was evaluated for both ACEI and anticoagulant activities. Moreover, the molecular docking results showed that this peptide had strong interactions with ACE and thrombin indicated by “-CDOCKER_Energy” scores of 207 and 171 kcal mol−1, respectively. Twelve ACE amino acid residues interacted with the peptide by forming 13 H-bonds, 7 electrostatic interactions, and 4 hydrophobic interactions. Eight thrombin amino acid residues interacted with peptide ENLPEKADRD by forming 10 H-bonds, 4 electrostatic interactions, and 1 hydrophobic interaction. These results showed that LF may potentially be used as an ingredient in functional food products with both antihypertensive and anticoagulant activities.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100806

VR	P02769	Serum albumin	Bos taurus	432-433	ACE-inhibitory		52.8				Identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides from ovine milk proteins by CE-MS and chromatographic techniques	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.	10.1002/elps.200700324

Dipeptides with a C terminal Pro inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a key enzyme in incretin hormone processing. It was hypothesised that tri- and tetrapeptides with a proline at the C-terminus may also be DPP-IV inhibitors. Therefore, an in silico hydrolysis approach was used to release short (4 ⩽ amino acids) C terminal Pro peptides from the individual caseins which constitute Pro rich substrates. This was achieved using theoretical digestion of caseins with a prolyl oligopeptidase activity. Fifteen peptides were subsequently selected for in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory analysis. Stability of these peptides to gastrointestinal enzymes was also evaluated in silico and the predicted breakdown peptides were assessed for their DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential. New DPP-IV inhibitors were identified, the most potent being Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (IC50 65.3 ± 3.5 μM). A low in vitro antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging) activity was also associated with the peptides studied.

IP	P02769	Serum albumin	Bos taurus	321-322	ACE-inhibitory		130.0				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056

Therefore, an in silico hydrolysis approach was used to release short (4 ⩽ amino acids) C terminal Pro peptides from the individual caseins which constitute Pro rich substrates. This was achieved using theoretical digestion of caseins with a prolyl oligopeptidase activity. Fifteen peptides were subsequently selected for in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory analysis. Stability of these peptides to gastrointestinal enzymes was also evaluated in silico and the predicted breakdown peptides were assessed for their DPP-IV inhibitory and antioxidant potential. New DPP-IV inhibitors were identified, the most potent being Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (IC50 65.3 ± 3.5 μM). A low in vitro antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging) activity was also associated with the peptides studied. The strategy presented highlights the utility of employing an in silico approach for the prediction of food-derived peptides with a potential role in glycaemic management for subsequent development of functional foods.	10.1016/j.jff.2013.09.012

FP	P02769	Serum albumin	Bos taurus	246-247	ACE-inhibitory		315.0				Characterisation of the hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoproteinase on bovine β-casein and determination of ACE inhibitory activity	Norris, R. et al.	The hydrolytic specificity of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoproteinase (An-PEP) on purified β-casein (β-CN) was assessed. This analysis confirmed cleavage at the C-terminal side of Pro residues. An-PEP also had the ability to cleave at the C-terminal side of Ala, Glu, Gly, Ser, Lys and Leu. Incubation of purified β-CN with An-PEP resulted in the generation of highly potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates. The most potent hydrolysate was obtained after 24 h incubation (ACE IC50 = 16.41 ± 6.06 μg/mL). Fourteen β-CN derived C-terminal Pro-containing di-, tri, and tetrapeptides which were predicted in silico to be released following An-PEP hydrolysis or which were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) in the 24 h hydrolysate were synthesised and characterised for their ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitory peptides were Ile-Gln-Ala (β-CN f187–189) and Val-Glu-Pro (β-CN f116–118) having ACE IC50 values of 32.9 ± 9.2 and 63.7 ± 12.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysates generated appear to have the most potent ACE IC50 values reported for a food derived hydrolysate to date.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.056
FP	P02769	Serum albumin	Bos taurus	246-247	ACE-inhibitory		315.0				Structural analysis of new antihypertensive peptides derived from cheese whey protein by proteinase K digestion	Abubakar, A. et al.	Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3
FP	P02769	Serum albumin	Bos taurus	246-247	ACE-inhibitory		205.0				Characterization of New Milk-derived Inhibitors of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme In Vitro and In Vivo	Fuglsang, A. et al.	inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been observed with a variety of different peptides, and peptide fragments with inhibitory capabilities have been identified within many different proteins, including milk proteins. The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.	10.1080/1475636031000138723
