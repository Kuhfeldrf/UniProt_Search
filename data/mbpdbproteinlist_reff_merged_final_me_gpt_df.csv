The peptide, termed kaliocin-1, and lactoferrin showed a bactericidal effect in assays performed in low-ionic-strength conditions. This is the first time that it is shown that the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin depends on the extracellular cation concentration. The antimicrobial effect of kaliocin-1 was lower than that of human lactoferrin, but their activities were inhibited by Na(+) or K(+) in a cation concentration-dependent manner.

In contrast, the peptide, but not lactoferrin, was able to permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes. The hypothetical interaction of kaliocin-1 with a bacterial membrane compound is discussed based in the different ion flux induced on cellular and artificial membranes as well as data from circular dichroism assays.

Three active peptides were purified by two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their structures were Tyr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Gly-Tyr-OCH3, Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-OCH2, and Lys-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Tyr-OCH3, which respectively correspond to the methyl esters of residues 318-323, 536-540, and 673-679 of human lactoferrin. The IC50 values of these peptides were 15, 10 and 23 microM, respectively, in a radioreceptor assay in the presence of 1 nM [3H]naloxone. In the myenteric plexus preparation of the longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum, the individual peptides had no opioid agonist activities, but they antagonized [Met5]enkephalin and morphiceptin when they were at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-5) M, suggesting that these were the opioid antagonist peptides. These three opioid antagonist peptides were named lactoferroxin A, B and C, after casoxin, the opioid antagonist peptide derived from bovine kappa-casein. Concerning the antagonist activities of lactoferroxins for opioid receptor sub-types, lactoferroxin A showed preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C had somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors. A study of the structure-activity relationship of the three lactoferroxins and their synthetic analogues showed that these opioid antagonist peptides derived from food protein could be expressed by the general formula XA-Tyr-XB-Tyr-OCH3. An amino acid in position XA may affect the specificity of the antagonist peptide for opioid receptor sub-types.",Opioid,"The peptide is directly described as having opioid antagonist activity, which qualifies it as having the function ""Opioid"".","The peptide has been found to have an affinity for opioid receptors. According to the sources (PubMed:1369293), it possesses opioid antagonist activity and shows higher preference for kappa-receptors than mu-receptors."

Small histidine-rich peptides were formed as early products of the action of the cell envelope-associated proteinases on kappa-casein, implicating this casein as a possible significant source of histidine, which is essential for starter growth. The major difference between the two proteinase types in their action on kappa-casein was in their ability to cleave bonds near the C-terminal end of the molecule. The bond Asn-160-Thr-161 and, to a lesser extent, the bond Glu-151-Val-152 were very rapidly cleaved by the PIII-type proteinase, whereas hydrolysis of these bonds by the PI-type proteinase was barely detectable (even after 24 h of digestion).
