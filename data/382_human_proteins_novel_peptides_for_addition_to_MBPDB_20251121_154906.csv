The peptide, termed kaliocin-1, and lactoferrin showed a bactericidal effect in assays performed in low-ionic-strength conditions. This is the first time that it is shown that the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin depends on the extracellular cation concentration. The antimicrobial effect of kaliocin-1 was lower than that of human lactoferrin, but their activities were inhibited by Na(+) or K(+) in a cation concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the peptide was able to mimic native lactoferrin, inducing K(+)-efflux and a selective dissipation of the transmembrane electrical potential of Escherichia coli cells without causing extensive damage to the outer and inner bacterial membranes. In contrast, the peptide, but not lactoferrin, was able to permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes. The hypothetical interaction of kaliocin-1 with a bacterial membrane compound is discussed based in the different ion flux induced on cellular and artificial membranes as well as data from circular dichroism assays. Kaliocin-1 was not cytotoxic and could be a suitable model for the design of analogs able to mimic the antibacterial effect of human lactoferrin.",FFSASCVPGADKGQFPNLCRLCAGTGENKCA,P02788,Antimicrobial,"The description explicitly states that Kaliocin-1 has antimicrobial activity and can affect bacterial membranes, leading to its classification as an antimicrobial peptide.","The peptide was shown to have a bactericidal effect and was able to induce K(+)-efflux and dissipation of the transmembrane electrical potential in Escherichia coli cells, as well as permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes."

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship.

A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans.",EVVPPQVLSEPNEEAGAALSPLPEVPPWTGEVSPAQR,P01160,Immunomodulatory,"Prostaglandin E2 has known roles in modulating immune responses, suggesting a possible immunomodulatory function for the peptide.","The peptide may enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis, which can have various immunomodulatory effects (PubMed:7595132)"

In vitro, sodium uptake into medullary collecting duct cells was inhibited, and tone of vascular smooth muscle was reduced, associated with activation of guanylate cyclase. Such previous studies have used heterologous peptides and species, e.g., human pro-ANP1-30 or pro-ANP31-67, tested in rat, pig, or dog. The present experiments were designed to test whether rat pro-ANP1-30 or pro-ANP31-67 were natriuretic and hypotensive in rats, whether the two peptides showed specific binding to plasma membranes from rat kidney cortex or aorta, and whether they affected particulate guanylate cyclase activity in rat glomerular membranes. To extend in vitro results from the literature, the effect of human pro-ANP31-67 on transport in the rat medullary collecting duct in vivo was also tested. Although rat ANP99-126, as expected, increased diuresis and natriuresis, associated with inhibition of transport in the medullary collecting duct, in identically treated rats human pro-ANP31-67 was without effect. Similarly, only the ANP99-126 infusion resulted in reduction of arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, no diuretic, natriuretic, or hypotensive responses were observed in rats infused with either rat pro-ANP31-67 or pro-ANP1-30. In plasma membranes from rat kidney cortex or aorta, neither of the rat prosegments showed specific binding, or interference with ANP99-126 receptors. Finally, in contrast to ANP99-126, neither of the prosegments was able to increase basal guanylate cyclase activity in rat glomerular membranes.

A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans.",APRSLRRSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLG,P01160,Increase in exocrine pancreatic secretion,"While there is not a direct mention of pancreatic secretion in the abstract, the implication of hormonal regulation suggests possible interactions with pancreatic functions, which involve complex endocrine responses.",“May have a role in cardio-renal homeostasis through regulation of natriuresis.

Three distinct NPs (ANP, BNP, and CNP) can selectively activate natriuretic peptide receptors, NPR-A and NPR-B, raising the cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) was found to rapidly cleave ANP, but the functional consequences of such cleavages in the cellular environment and the molecular mechanism of recognition and cleavage remain unknown. Here, we show that reducing expression levels of IDE profoundly alters the response of NPR-A and NPR-B to the stimulation of ANP, BNP, and CNP in cultured cells. IDE rapidly cleaves ANP and CNP, thus inactivating their ability to raise intracellular cGMP. Conversely, reduced IDE expression enhances the stimulation of NPR-A and NPR-B by ANP and CNP, respectively. Instead of proteolytic inactivation, IDE cleavage can lead to hyperactivation of BNP toward NPR-A. Conversely, decreasing IDE expression reduces BNP-mediated signaling. Additionally, the cleavages of ANP and BNP by IDE render them active with NPR-B and a reduction of IDE expression diminishes the ability of ANP and BNP to stimulate NPR-B. Our kinetic and crystallographic analyses offer the molecular basis for the selective degradation of NPs and their variants by IDE. Furthermore, our studies reveal how IDE utilizes its catalytic chamber and exosite to engulf and bind up to two NPs leading to biased stochastic, non-sequential cleavages and the ability of IDE to switch its substrate selectivity. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved IDE may play a key role in modulating and reshaping the strength and duration of NP-mediated signaling.",SLRRSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLGCNSFRY,P01160,Immunomodulatory,"Although not explicitly stated, since natriuretic peptides are involved in various biological processes, including response modulation in tissues, this suggests potential immunomodulatory effects.",PubMed:15166840 (inferred from related research)

In circulation, the proteolytic inactivation of ANP has been demonstrated to involve both membrane metalloendopeptidase and an aprotonin-sensitive activity, probably corresponding to kallikrein [Vanneste, Y., Pauwels, S., Lambotte, L., Michel, A., Dimaline, R. & Deschodt-Lanckman, M. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 801-806]. In the present study, we focused on the aprotinin-sensitive pathway of ANP metabolism. In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28.

Binds the clearance receptor NPR3 which removes the hormone from circulation (PubMed:1672777).",Atrial natriuretic peptide,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a 28-amino-acid hormone involved in the regulation of fluid balance. In circulation, the proteolytic inactivation of ANP has been demonstrated to involve both membrane metalloendopeptidase and an aprotonin-sensitive activity, probably corresponding to kallikrein [Vanneste, Y., Pauwels, S., Lambotte, L., Michel, A., Dimaline, R. & Deschodt-Lanckman, M. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 801-806]. In the present study, we focused on the aprotinin-sensitive pathway of ANP metabolism. In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28. These results indicate that the aprotinin-sensitive activity involved in the metabolism of ANP in circulation could correspond to tissue kallikrein. However, clear identification of ANP as a novel physiological substrate of the enzyme will need further investigation.",SLRRSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLGCNSFRY,P01160,Cytomodulatory,ANP's role in modulating cellular responses in the heart indicates its cytomodulatory effects on cardiac tissue.,Inhibiting cardiac remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy by inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis

Increasing concentrations of urodilatin yielded a monophasic displacement of 125I-ANP binding with an IC50 of 4.2 nM, a value nearly identical to that achieved with unlabeled ANP (7.2 nM). In additional experiments, rat glomeruli and inner medullary collecting duct cells were isolated and incubated in vitro with either ANP or urodilatin (10(-11) to 10(-6) M) and cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate accumulation measured by radioimmunoassay.

Thus, urodilatin is as effective as ANP in displacing 125I-ANP binding to both rat and human renal tissue and in generating cyclic guanosine monophosphate in renal target cells in the rat, suggesting that its physiological effects may occur through the same receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the actions of ANP.",SLRRSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLGCNSFRY,P01160,Antihypertensive,"ANP is known to have a key role in lowering blood pressure by promoting natriuresis and vasodilation, which makes it relevant to antihypertensive activity.","The peptide regulates blood pressure and is involved in vasodilation and controlling extracellular fluid volume, as specified in the associated functions.

We engineered three chimeric proteins consisting of the natriuretic peptide receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG-gamma 1. These molecules provide material for detailed studies of the human receptor's extracellular domain structure and interaction with the three human natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and type-C natriuretic peptide (CNP). The homodimeric fusion proteins, designated A-IgG, B-IgG, and C-IgG, were secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by protein-A affinity chromatography. We present here the primary characterization of these fusion proteins as represented by the intrinsic hormone affinities measured by saturation binding and competition assays. The dissociation constant of 125I-ANP for A-IgG was 1.6 pM and for C-IgG, 1.2 pM. The dissociation constant of 125I-Y0-CNP (CNP with addition of tyrosine at the amino terminus) for B-IgG was 23 pM. The rank order of potency in competitive binding for A-IgG was ANP greater than BNP much greater than CNP, whereas for B-IgG the ranking was CNP much greater than ANP greater than BNP. For C-IgG, we observed ANP greater than CNP greater than or equal to BNP. These data demonstrate that the receptor-IgG fusion proteins discriminate among the natriuretic peptides in the same manner as the native receptors and provide a basis for future structural studies with these molecules.

This includes up-regulating lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxygen utilization by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and increasing energy expenditure by acting via MAPK11 to promote the UCP1-dependent thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (PubMed:15741263, PubMed:18835931, PubMed:21672517, PubMed:22307324). Binds the clearance receptor NPR3 which removes the hormone from circulation (PubMed:1672777).",Atrial natriuretic peptide,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone essential for the regulation of blood pressure. In cardiac myocytes, ANP is synthesized as a precursor, pro-ANP, that is converted to biologically active ANP by an unknown membrane-associated protease. Recently, we cloned a transmembrane serine protease, corin, that is highly expressed in the heart. In this study, we examine effects of corin on pro-ANP processing. Our results show that recombinant human corin converts pro-ANP to ANP and that the cleavage in pro-ANP by corin is highly sequence specific. Our findings suggest that corin is the long-sought pro-ANP-converting enzyme and that the corin-mediated pro-ANP activation may play a role in regulating blood pressure.",SLRRSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLGCNSFRY,P01160,Cholesterol regulation,"By influencing lipid metabolism pathways, ANP plays a role in cholesterol management and overall energy homeostasis, thereby supporting the cholesterol regulation function.","ANP acts in adipose tissue to regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, as mentioned in PubMed:22307324.

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans.",RSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLGCNSFR,P01160,Cytomodulatory,"Cytomodulatory functions typically involve effects on cellular processes, and the mechanisms described suggest that Auriculin-A influences renal cellular functions related to sodium handling.","The references to the peptide's role in enhancing prostaglandin E2 synthesis and its effects on sodium excretion through inhibition of renal Na+-K+-ATPase suggest potential modulatory actions on cellular activities in the kidney.

The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplant and chronic renal failure, using radioimmunoassays directed towards the mid-portion pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) of the N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (99-126). The circulating form(s) of the immunoreactive N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma extracts has been investigated using all three radioimmunoassays by means of gel filtration chromatography to further clarify the major immunoreactive molecular circulating form(s) of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in man. 2. The plasma level (mean +/- SEM) of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) in the normal subjects was 547.2 +/- 32.7 pg/ml (n = 36) and was significantly elevated in patients with essential hypertension (730.2 +/- 72.3 pg/ml, P < 0.025, n = 39), in cardiac transplant recipients (3214.0 +/- 432.2 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 9) and in patients with chronic renal failure (3571.8 +/- 474.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 11).

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists.

Proepithelin (PEPI), an epithelial growth factor, can be converted to epithelins (EPIs) in vivo by unknown mechanisms with unknown consequences. We found that PEPI and EPIs exert opposing activities.

This receptor type recognizes PACAP-38 and VIP similar affinity with inhibition concentrations of IC50 = 6.2 +/- 4.8 nM for PACAP-38 and IC50 = 9.4 +/- 4.6 nM for VIP. Like the other two PACAP receptors types, PACAP/VIP R-2 is coupled to cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathway with effective doses ED50 = 3.2 +/- 1.6 nM and ED50 = 2.2 +/- 0.9 nM for PACAP-38 and VIP respectively. Transcripts of the common PACAP/VIP R-2 are also found in human brain and a number of peripheral tissues, such as pancreas, muscle, heart, lund, kidney, stomach and low levels in the liver. Comparison of the tissue distribution of the human PACAP/VIP R-2 to that of the other two types of human PACAP receptors (PACAP-Type 1 and the other common PACAP/VIP R-1) by RNase protection showed that each of the three PACAP receptors is expressed in a unique set of human peripheral tissues.

Selective AMYR agonists and dual AMYR/CTR agonists are being developed as obesity treatments; however, the molecular basis for peptide binding and selectivity is unknown. We determined the structure and dynamics of active AMYRs with amylin, AMY<sub>1</sub>R with salmon CT (sCT), AMY<sub>2</sub>R with sCT or human CT (hCT), and CTR with amylin, sCT, or hCT. The conformation of amylin-bound complexes was similar for all AMYRs, constrained by the RAMP, and an ordered midpeptide motif that we call the bypass motif.

LL-37 is considered to play an important role in the first line of defence against local infection and systemic invasion of pathogens at sites of inflammation and wounds. Understanding its mode of action may assist in the development of antimicrobial agents mimicking those of the human immune system. In vitro studies revealed that LL-37 is cytotoxic to both bacterial and normal eukaryotic cells. To gain insight into the mechanism of its non-cell-selective cytotoxicity, we synthesized and structurally and functionally characterized LL-37, its N-terminal truncated form FF-33, and their fluorescent derivatives (which retained structure and activity). The results showed several differences, between LL-37 and other native antimicrobial peptides, that may shed light on its in vivo activities. Most interestingly, LL-37 exists in equilibrium between monomers and oligomers in solution at very low concentrations. Also, it is significantly resistant to proteolytic degradation in solution, and when bound to both zwitterionic (mimicking mammalian membranes) and negatively charged membranes (mimicking bacterial membranes).

The crystal structure of LL-37 displays dimers of anti-parallel helices and the formation of amphipathic surfaces. Peptide-detergent interactions introduce remodeling of this structure after occupation of defined hydrophobic sites at the dimer interface. Furthermore, hydrophobic nests are shaped between dimer structures providing another scaffold enclosing detergents. Both scaffolds underline the potential of LL-37 to form defined peptide-lipid complexes in vivo. After adopting the activated peptide conformation LL-37 can polymerize and selectively extract bacterial lipids whereby the membrane is destabilized. The supramolecular fibril-like architectures formed in crystals can be reproduced in a peptide-lipid system after nanogold-labelled LL-37 interacted with lipid vesicles as followed by electron microscopy.

To explore the mechanism by which the important cathelicidin peptide LL-37 of the human innate immune system interacts with membranes, we performed biochemical, biophysical and structural studies. The crystal structure of LL-37 displays dimers of anti-parallel helices and the formation of amphipathic surfaces. Peptide-detergent interactions introduce remodeling of this structure after occupation of defined hydrophobic sites at the dimer interface. Furthermore, hydrophobic nests are shaped between dimer structures providing another scaffold enclosing detergents. Both scaffolds underline the potential of LL-37 to form defined peptide-lipid complexes in vivo. After adopting the activated peptide conformation LL-37 can polymerize and selectively extract bacterial lipids whereby the membrane is destabilized. The supramolecular fibril-like architectures formed in crystals can be reproduced in a peptide-lipid system after nanogold-labelled LL-37 interacted with lipid vesicles as followed by electron microscopy.

Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18-29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells. NMR structural analysis revealed a short three-turn amphipathic helix rich in positively charged side chains, allowing for effective competition for anionic phosphatidylglycerols in bacterial membranes. KR-12 may be a useful peptide template for developing novel antimicrobial agents of therapeutic use.",LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES,P49913,Wound healing,"While not explicitly stated, its involvement in innate immunity and healing-related cytokine production supports its role in facilitating wound healing.","As a key component of the innate immune system, LL-37 plays an essential role in protecting humans against infectious diseases, which is often crucial during wound healing processes.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells. Structural analysis revealed hydrophobic defects in the new amphipathic structure of the D-peptide, leading to a much shorter retention time on a reversed-phase HPLC column.

In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization.",LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQR,P49913,Immunomodulatory,The ability to modulate immune responses by influencing cytokine release indicates that the peptide plays a role in immunomodulation.,"The peptide enhances the release of CXCL2 via neutrophil N-formyl peptide receptors and can induce pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF/TNFA and CCL2/MCP1 (PubMed:22879591, PubMed:14978112).

To elucidate the structural basis for its targeting bacterial membrane, we have determined the high quality structure of (13)C,(15)N-labeled LL-37 by three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy, because two-dimensional (1)H NMR did not provide sufficient spectral resolution. The structure of LL-37 in SDS micelles is composed of a curved amphipathic helix-bend-helix motif spanning residues 2-31 followed by a disordered C-terminal tail. The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and (15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles.

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway.",FFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES,P49913,Antimicrobial,"The peptide has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial properties by inhibiting the growth of specific bacteria, which directly supports its classification as antimicrobial.","Inhibits the growth of Gram-negative E.coli and E.aerogenes with efficiencies comparable to that of the mature peptide LL-37 (in vitro) (PubMed:9736536).""

Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells. Structural analysis revealed hydrophobic defects in the new amphipathic structure of the D-peptide, leading to a much shorter retention time on a reversed-phase HPLC column.

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells. Structural analysis revealed hydrophobic defects in the new amphipathic structure of the D-peptide, leading to a much shorter retention time on a reversed-phase HPLC column. It is proposed that hydrophobic defects as a result of incoherent hydrophobic packing provide a structural basis for the improvement in cell selectivity of the LL-37 fragment.",RKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES,P49913,Antimicrobial,"The peptide is explicitly described as having antimicrobial properties and is compared in effectiveness to mature peptides like LL-37, supporting its classification under antimicrobial functions.","Acts as an antimicrobial protein integral to the innate immune system, binding to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and inhibiting the growth of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and E. aerogenes.

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway.",KSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES,P49913,Antimicrobial,"The evidence consistently highlights the peptide's antibacterial properties and its role in the innate immune response, matching the function of being antimicrobial.","The peptide is described as an antimicrobial protein that is an integral component of the innate immune system, with references to its ability to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative E. coli and E. aerogenes, and its synergistic effect with other antimicrobial peptides against bacteria such as S. aureus and C. albicans (PubMed:14978112, PubMed:9736536)"

The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and (15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles. The structure of LL-37 serves as a model for understanding the structure and function relationship of homologous primate cathelicidins. Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18-29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells. NMR structural analysis revealed a short three-turn amphipathic helix rich in positively charged side chains, allowing for effective competition for anionic phosphatidylglycerols in bacterial membranes. KR-12 may be a useful peptide template for developing novel antimicrobial agents of therapeutic use.",KRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES,P49913,Cytotoxic,"The hemolytic activity indicates cytotoxic effects on certain cell types, which fits within the cytotoxic function category.","Exhibits hemolytic activity against human red blood cells.""

"['Functions as a cell surface receptor and performs physiological functions on the surface of neurons relevant to neurite growth, neuronal adhesion and axonogenesis. Interaction between APP molecules on neighboring cells promotes synaptogenesis (PubMed:25122912). Involved in cell mobility and transcription regulation through protein-protein interactions. Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibits Notch signaling through interaction with Numb. Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(o) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity (By similarity). Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1 (By similarity). By acting as a kinesin I membrane receptor, plays a role in axonal anterograde transport of cargo towards synapses in axons (PubMed:17062754, PubMed:23011729). Involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. In vitro, copper-metallated APP induces neuronal death directly or is potentiated through Cu(2+)-mediated low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV. The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1.', 'Amyloid-beta peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Bind transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. In vitro, can reduce Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) to Cu(+) and Fe(2+), respectively. Amyloid-beta peptides bind to lipoproteins and apolipoproteins E and J in the CSF and to HDL particles in plasma, inhibiting metal-catalyzed oxidation of lipoproteins.
