The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption.",Increase cellular growth,"Natriuresis can increase the renal blood flow which can potentially promote cellular growth.

In circulation, the proteolytic inactivation of ANP has been demonstrated to involve both membrane metalloendopeptidase and an aprotonin-sensitive activity, probably corresponding to kallikrein [Vanneste, Y., Pauwels, S., Lambotte, L., Michel, A., Dimaline, R. & Deschodt-Lanckman, M.

In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28.

In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28. These results indicate that the aprotinin-sensitive activity involved in the metabolism of ANP in circulation could correspond to tissue kallikrein. However, clear identification of ANP as a novel physiological substrate of the enzyme will need further investigation.",Enhance insulin signaling,"The peptide's ability to regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, including the activation of AMPK, indicates a potential role in enhancing insulin signaling.","In adipose tissue, acts in various cGMP- and PKG-dependent pathways to regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.

This vasodilation was associated with a 4 to 5 fold increase in cyclic GMP in the aorta secondary to activation of particulate guanylate cyclase [E.C. 4.6.12].

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr.

Conversely, reduced IDE expression enhances the stimulation of NPR-A and NPR-B by ANP and CNP, respectively. Instead of proteolytic inactivation, IDE cleavage can lead to hyperactivation of BNP toward NPR-A. Conversely, decreasing IDE expression reduces BNP-mediated signaling. Additionally, the cleavages of ANP and BNP by IDE render them active with NPR-B and a reduction of IDE expression diminishes the ability of ANP and BNP to stimulate NPR-B. Our kinetic and crystallographic analyses offer the molecular basis for the selective degradation of NPs and their variants by IDE. Furthermore, our studies reveal how IDE utilizes its catalytic chamber and exosite to engulf and bind up to two NPs leading to biased stochastic, non-sequential cleavages and the ability of IDE to switch its substrate selectivity.

N-terminal end of the prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor (proANF) which circulates in man were investigated to determine if they have specific binding sites on membranes isolated from DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF). Each peptide bound to DDT1 MF-2 membranes between 10(-8) to 10(-11) M but could only bind to the other peptides' receptors at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-7)M.

The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplant and chronic renal failure, using radioimmunoassays directed towards the mid-portion pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) of the N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (99-126). The circulating form(s) of the immunoreactive N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma extracts has been investigated using all three radioimmunoassays by means of gel filtration chromatography to further clarify the major immunoreactive molecular circulating form(s) of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in man. 2. The plasma level (mean +/- SEM) of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) in the normal subjects was 547.2 +/- 32.7 pg/ml (n = 36) and was significantly elevated in patients with essential hypertension (730.2 +/- 72.3 pg/ml, P < 0.025, n = 39), in cardiac transplant recipients (3214.0 +/- 432.2 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 9) and in patients with chronic renal failure (3571.8 +/- 474.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 11).

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values.

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold.

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold.

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship.

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm.",Increase exocrine pancreatic secretion,"Since prostaglandins are known to stimulate the secretion of bicarbonate and digestive enzymes in the exocrine pancreas, enhancing their synthesis could potentially lead to increased exocrine pancreatic secretion.","The peptide is said to enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis (PubMed:7720651), which can trigger an increase in exocrine pancreatic secretion"

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties.

Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period.

The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplant and chronic renal failure, using radioimmunoassays directed towards the mid-portion pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) of the N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (99-126). The circulating form(s) of the immunoreactive N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma extracts has been investigated using all three radioimmunoassays by means of gel filtration chromatography to further clarify the major immunoreactive molecular circulating form(s) of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in man. 2. The plasma level (mean +/- SEM) of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) in the normal subjects was 547.2 +/- 32.7 pg/ml (n = 36) and was significantly elevated in patients with essential hypertension (730.2 +/- 72.3 pg/ml, P < 0.025, n = 39), in cardiac transplant recipients (3214.0 +/- 432.2 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 9) and in patients with chronic renal failure (3571.8 +/- 474.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 11).

ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption.",Increase cellular growth,"cGMP is a cellular messenger with various effects, including promoting cell proliferation, which is the increase in cell numbers due to cell growth and division.","in vitro, it promotes the production of cGMP"

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity.

LL-37 can interact with molecules of the cell wall and perforate cytoplasmic membranes resulting in bacterial cell death. To test the interactions of LL-37 and bacterial cell wall components we crystallized LL-37 in the presence of detergents and obtained the structure of a narrow tetrameric channel with a strongly charged core. The formation of a tetramer was further studied by cross-linking in the presence of detergents and lipids. Using planar lipid membranes a small but defined conductivity of this channel could be demonstrated. Molecular dynamic simulations underline the stability of this channel in membranes and demonstrate pathways for the passage of water molecules. Time lapse studies of E. coli cells treated with LL-37 show membrane discontinuities in the outer membrane followed by cell wall damage and cell death. Collectively, our results open a venue to the understanding of a novel AMP killing mechanism and allows the rational design of LL-37 derivatives with enhanced bactericidal activity.",Cytotoxic,"The ability to cause cell death or damage, such as the described hemolytic activity and the lysis of bacterial cells, qualifies as 'cytotoxicity'.",The peptide LL-37 has demonstrated hemolytic activity against red blood cells and can cause cell death in microbes like E.coli by rupturing their membranes.

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway.",Antimicrobial,"As the peptide shows clear activity against a variety of bacterial species and can disrupt bacterial cell membranes, it is functioning as an antimicrobial.","The description provides multiple pieces of evidence for antimicrobial activity.

They also have diverse biological functions in wound healing, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation, where it has also been demonstrated that they have a high affinity to interact with human lipid signaling molecules. Within bacterial biofilms, quorum sensing (QS), the vital bacterial cell-to-cell communication system, is maintained by similar diffusible small molecules which control phenotypic traits, virulence factors, biofilm formation, and dispersion. Efficient eradication of bacterial biofilms is of particular importance as these colonies greatly help individual cells to tolerate antibiotics and develop antimicrobial resistance. Regarding the antibacterial function, for several HDPs, including the human cathelicidin LL-37, affinity to eradicate biofilms can exceed their activity to kill individual bacteria. However, related underlying molecular mechanisms have not been explored yet. Here, we employed circular dichroism (CD) and UV/VIS spectroscopic analysis, which revealed that LL-37 exhibits QS signal affinity. This archetypal representative of HDPs interacts with the <i>Pseudomonas</i> quinolone signal (PQS) molecules, producing co-assemblies with peculiar optical activity. The binding of PQS onto the asymmetric peptide chains results in chiral supramolecular architectures consisting of helically disposed, J-aggregated molecules. Besides the well-known bacterial membrane disruption activity, our data propose a novel action mechanism of LL-37.

To elucidate the structural basis for its targeting bacterial membrane, we have determined the high quality structure of (13)C,(15)N-labeled LL-37 by three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy, because two-dimensional (1)H NMR did not provide sufficient spectral resolution. The structure of LL-37 in SDS micelles is composed of a curved amphipathic helix-bend-helix motif spanning residues 2-31 followed by a disordered C-terminal tail. The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and (15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles. The structure of LL-37 serves as a model for understanding the structure and function relationship of homologous primate cathelicidins. Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18-29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells. Structural analysis revealed hydrophobic defects in the new amphipathic structure of the D-peptide, leading to a much shorter retention time on a reversed-phase HPLC column. It is proposed that hydrophobic defects as a result of incoherent hydrophobic packing provide a structural basis for the improvement in cell selectivity of the LL-37 fragment.",Anticancer,"The peptide is shown to have anticancer activity, being effective against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells.","The peptide is also described to have anticancer activity.

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37.

To elucidate the structural basis for its targeting bacterial membrane, we have determined the high quality structure of (13)C,(15)N-labeled LL-37 by three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy, because two-dimensional (1)H NMR did not provide sufficient spectral resolution. The structure of LL-37 in SDS micelles is composed of a curved amphipathic helix-bend-helix motif spanning residues 2-31 followed by a disordered C-terminal tail. The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and (15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles. The structure of LL-37 serves as a model for understanding the structure and function relationship of homologous primate cathelicidins. Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18-29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells.

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure.

Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells. Structural analysis revealed hydrophobic defects in the new amphipathic structure of the D-peptide, leading to a much shorter retention time on a reversed-phase HPLC column.

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37. In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization.",Cytomodulatory,"The ability of the peptide to induce cytokine and chemokine responses can be associated with modulating cellular activities, indicating a cytomechanism, which matches ""Cytomodulatory"" from the potential functions list.",The RK-31 peptide is able to induce the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF/TNFA or the chemokine CCL2/MCP1 (PubMed:14978112).

To elucidate the structural basis for its targeting bacterial membrane, we have determined the high quality structure of (13)C,(15)N-labeled LL-37 by three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy, because two-dimensional (1)H NMR did not provide sufficient spectral resolution. The structure of LL-37 in SDS micelles is composed of a curved amphipathic helix-bend-helix motif spanning residues 2-31 followed by a disordered C-terminal tail. The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and (15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles. The structure of LL-37 serves as a model for understanding the structure and function relationship of homologous primate cathelicidins. Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18-29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells. NMR structural analysis revealed a short three-turn amphipathic helix rich in positively charged side chains, allowing for effective competition for anionic phosphatidylglycerols in bacterial membranes. KR-12 may be a useful peptide template for developing novel antimicrobial agents of therapeutic use.",Cytotoxic,"The term ""hemolytic activity"" refers to the destruction of red blood cells, which is a cytotoxic activity.",The peptide exhibits hemolytic activity against human red blood cells

The glucagon-like peptides, GLP-1 and GLP-2 are prototype peptide hormones released from gut endocrine cells in response to nutrient ingestion that regulate not only energy absorption and disposal, but also cell proliferation and survival. GLP-1 expands islet mass by stimulating pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and induction of islet neogenesis. GLP-1 also promotes cell differentiation, from exocrine cells or immature islet progenitors, toward a more differentiated beta-cell phenotype. GLP-2 stimulates cell proliferation in the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading to expansion of the normal mucosal epithelium, or attenuation of intestinal injury in experimental models of intestinal disease. Both GLP-1 and GLP-2 exert antiapoptotic actions in vivo, resulting in preservation of beta-cell mass and gut epithelium, respectively. Furthermore, GLP-1 and GLP-2 promote direct resistance to apoptosis in cells expressing GLP-1 or GLP-2 receptors. Moreover, an increasing number of structurally related peptide hormones and neuropeptides exert cytoprotective effects through G protein-coupled receptor activation in diverse cell types. Hence, peptide hormones, as exemplified by GLP-1 and GLP-2, may prove to be useful adjunctive tools for enhancement of cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and cytoprotection for the treatment of human disease.",Ameliorates insulin resistance,"By releasing insulin in a glucose-dependent manner, the peptide might improve the body's sensitivity to insulin, and therefore potentially ameliorate insulin resistance.",Peptide stimulates glucose-dependent insulin release.

The glucagon-like peptides, GLP-1 and GLP-2 are prototype peptide hormones released from gut endocrine cells in response to nutrient ingestion that regulate not only energy absorption and disposal, but also cell proliferation and survival. GLP-1 expands islet mass by stimulating pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and induction of islet neogenesis. GLP-1 also promotes cell differentiation, from exocrine cells or immature islet progenitors, toward a more differentiated beta-cell phenotype. GLP-2 stimulates cell proliferation in the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading to expansion of the normal mucosal epithelium, or attenuation of intestinal injury in experimental models of intestinal disease. Both GLP-1 and GLP-2 exert antiapoptotic actions in vivo, resulting in preservation of beta-cell mass and gut epithelium, respectively.
