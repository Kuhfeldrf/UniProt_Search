Has antimicrobial activity, which depends on the extracellular cation concentration (PubMed:6802759). Antimicrobial properties include bacteriostasis, which is related to its ability to sequester free iron and thus inhibit microbial growth, as well as direct bactericidal properties leading to the release of lipopolysaccharides from the bacterial outer membrane (PubMed:14573629, PubMed:1599934, PubMed:6802759, PubMed:3169987, PubMed:11179314, PubMed:12693969). Can also prevent bacterial biofilm development in P.aeruginosa infection (PubMed:12037568). Has weak antifungal activity against C.albicans (PubMed:11083624). Has anabolic, differentiating and anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts and can also inhibit osteoclastogenesis, possibly playing a role in the regulation of bone growth (PubMed:15166119). Promotes binding of species C adenoviruses to epithelial cells, promoting adenovirus infection (PubMed:17079302). Can inhibit papillomavirus infections (PubMed:17481742). Stimulates the TLR4 signaling pathway leading to NF-kappa-B activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production while also interfering with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TLR4 signaling (PubMed:20345905). Inhibits neutrophil granulocyte migration to sites of apoptosis, when secreted by apoptotic cells (PubMed:19033648). Stimulates VEGFA-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation (PubMed:16842782). Binds heparin, chondroitin sulfate and possibly other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (PubMed:9359845). Also binds specifically to pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), the lipid A portion of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysozyme and DNA (PubMed:9359845).', 'Lactoferricin binds to the bacterial surface and is crucial for the bactericidal functions. Has some antiviral activity against papillomavirus infection (PubMed:17481742). N-terminal region shows strong antifungal activity against C.albicans (PubMed:11083624). Contains two BBXB heparin-binding consensus sequences that appear to form the predominate functional GAG-binding site.', 'Has antimicrobial activity and is able to permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes.', 'Has opioid antagonist activity (PubMed:1369293).
