Casein is also considered as a source of amino acids and generating peptides with biological activities such as opiate, immunostimulating, antibacterial, peptidase inhibitors, among others. In this work, Sephadex G-10 chromatography followed by high-performance liquid chromatography isolation purified NZCase TT, an industrial culture media for tetanus toxin production. In the first step, four pools were isolated and tested in different assays: isolated smooth muscle assay (guinea pig ileum, rat uterus), phagocytosis in vitro of opsonized sheep red blood cells, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Pool III was the main active pool being able to potentiate bradykinin action in guinea pig ileum, stimulating phagocitic activity by resident macrophages and increasing H2O2 release from macrophages previously activated with bacille Calmette Gu√©rin. Using mass spectra the primary structure of the main peptide from pool III was obtained--INKKI, which corresponds to beta-casein fragment 26-30. The immunostimulating action is probably related to a direct action in macrophage cells."

This paper describes the isolation and sequencing of a novel bradykinin-potentiating peptide, generated by tryptic hydrolysis of the gamma-casein chain. No homology was found to other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides. The octapeptide Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe-Thr-Glu, corresponding to the gamma-casein(114-121) sequence, was isolated from the tryptic hydrolysis of gamma-casein and also synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Both natural and synthetic peptides had the same retention time in HPLC and displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea-pig ileum for bradykinin and Lys-bradykinin but were not able to potentiate the effects of Met-Lys-bradykinin, Ile-Ser-bradykinin, angiotensin II, acetylcholine, or histamine. Intravenous injections of bradykinin and of bradykinin-potentiating octapeptide produced a persistent hypotension in conscious rats, a pattern that was not obtained when the octapeptide was replaced by captopril. This bradykinin-potentiating octapeptide is a strong competitive inhibitor of endo-oligopeptidase A (EC 3.4.24.15, formerly EC 3.4.22.19), but it has low inhibitory potency towards angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1). Thus, our results suggest that other peptidases in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme, such as endo-oligopeptidase A, may contribute to the reduction of the effective concentration of bradykinin in the circulation."

This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108-113 and 114-121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response."

The peptide bonds Ala-23-Lys-24, Leu-32-Ser-33, Ala-71-Gln-72, Leu-79-Ser-80, Met-95-Ala-96, and Met-106-Ala-107 were cleaved by both proteinase types, although the relative rates of hydrolysis at some of these sites were quite different for the two proteinases. Small histidine-rich peptides were formed as early products of the action of the cell envelope-associated proteinases on kappa-casein, implicating this casein as a possible significant source of histidine, which is essential for starter growth. The major difference between the two proteinase types in their action on kappa-casein was in their ability to cleave bonds near the C-terminal end of the molecule. The bond Asn-160-Thr-161 and, to a lesser extent, the bond Glu-151-Val-152 were very rapidly cleaved by the PIII-type proteinase, whereas hydrolysis of these bonds by the PI-type proteinase was barely detectable (even after 24 h of digestion). Differential hydrolysis of kappa-casein at these sites by the two different proteinase types resulted in the formation of distinctive, high-M(r) products detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A single active peptide representing this domain was isolated following gastric pepsin cleavage of human lactoferrin, and bovine lactoferrin, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The antimicrobial sequence was found to consist mainly of a loop of 18 amino acid residues formed by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 20 and 37 of human lactoferrin, or 19 and 36 of bovine lactoferrin. Synthetic analogs of this region similarly exhibited potent antibacterial properties. The active peptide of bovine lactoferrin was more potent than that of human lactoferrin having effectiveness against various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria at concentrations between 0.3 microM and 3.0 microM, depending on the target strain. The effect of the isolated domain was lethal causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability. Our studies suggest this domain is the structural region responsible for the bacterial properties of lactoferrin."
