INKKI	P02666	INKKI	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	41-45	Anticancer	Cytoxic for B16F10 melanoma cells					Antitumor Effect of Cationic INKKI Peptide from Bovine β-Casein on Melanoma B16F10	Azeveda, RA. et al.	Cationic peptide with the sequence INKKI 41-45 was isolated from bovine β-casein after tryptic hydrolysis and synthetized. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity in vitro and antitumor effect in animal model. The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated on B16F10 melanoma cells by MTT assay. Detection of apoptosis was measured using the annexin V/PI double staining and cell cycle analysis performed flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activity was analyzed with substrate specific fluorogenic DEVD-MCA. In vivo, antitumor activity was evaluated in B16F10 melanoma tumor-bearing C57BL/6J mice. The animals were treated with 55 mg/kg INKKI administered into peritumoral region, while control group received saline solution. The following antitumor parameters were examined: tumor volume, number of metastases, tumor delayed time, tumor doubling time. Histological analyses were performed with H & E staining. The results showed that INKKI induced dose-response cytotoxicity selective for B16F10 melanoma cells (IC50 1.7 μM) and did not present cytotoxic effects for FN1 fibroblast cells. INKKI-induced apoptosis detected trough of annexin V/PI assay and it was accompanied with an increase of sub-G1 apoptotic fractions and significant increase of caspase-3 cleavage. The tumor-bearing mice treated with INKKI showed a significant reduction in tumor volume of 72.62% and decreased of metastasis number loci. In addition, INKKI caused a significant delay in tumor growth and prolonged the tumor doubling time. Histological analysis revealed an increased of necrosis areas and reduction of tumor cells in tumor treated with INKKI, it was a many hallmark of its antitumor effects observed from in vivo experiments. In conclusion, we show that INKKI is a peptide that could be considered a new putative candidate development to anticancer therapy drug.	10.4236/jct.2012.34034	sequence	IDENTITY
VKEAMAPK	P02666	VKEAMAPK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	113-120	Antimicrobial				Gram negative		Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY
VKEAMAPK	P02666	VKEAMAPK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	113-120	Antioxidant						Caseins and Casein Hydrolysates 2 Antioxidative Properties and Relevance to Lipoxygenase Inhibition	Rival, S. et al.	The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.	10.1021/jf0003911	sequence	IDENTITY
YPVEPFTE	P02666	YPVEPFTE	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-136	Bradykinin-Potentiating						Biochemical and Pharmacological Aspects of Two Bradykinin-Potentiating Peptides Obtained from Tryptic Hydrolysis of Casein	Perpetuo, EA. et al.	Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff	sequence	IDENTITY

We examined the activity of bovine lactoferricin (Lfcin-B), a peptide derived from a bovine milk protein lactoferrin (LF-B), to induce apoptosis in THP-1 human monocytic leukemic cells. Treatment with Lfcin-B at up to 50 μg/ml induced cell death in THP-1 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner, showing apparent morphological changes, hypodiploid forms of genomic DNA and apoptotic DNA fragmentation, whereas LF-B was inactive even at a high dose (500 μg/ml). The apoptosis-inducing effect of Lfcin-B increased with reduction of serum concentration, but was inhibited by addition of Zn2+, a inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Lfcin-B-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells was completely abolished by addition of antioxidants such asN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH), but not by various cytokines and mitogen which can activate monocytic cells. In addition, THP-1 cells treated with Lfcin-B, but not LF-B, showed high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the early period (20 min) of Lfcin-B treatment. And the production of ROS by Lfcin-B was dependent upon the dose of Lfcin-B added. These results suggested that Lfcin-B, a LF-B-derived peptide, but not LF-B itself, is able to induce apoptosis in THP-1 human monocytic tumor cells, and that its apoptosis-inducing activity is related to the pathway mediated by production of the intracellular ROS and activation of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases.	10.1006/bbrc.1997.7199	sequence	IDENTITY

Among the four species investigated peptides based on the bovine sequence displayed significant activity. The bovine sequence, bovine lactoferricin, showed a MIC value of 30 μg/mL on E. coli and S. aureus, whereas the three other lactoferricins possessed MIC values above 200 μg/mL. Based on these findings, novel peptides with enhanced antibacterial activities, were prepared with sequences designed by molecular modelling and structure-activity studies.

2) Antimicrobial peptides derived from food proteins constitute a new field in the combined use of antimicrobial agents in food. The best examples of milk-derived peptides are those constituted by bovine lactoferricin [lactoferrin f(17–41)] (LFcin-B) and bovine αs2-casein f(183–207). The aim of this work was to study if the antimicrobial activity of a natural compound employed in food preservation, nisin, could be enhanced by combination with the aforementioned milk-derived peptides. Furthermore, the possibility of a synergistic effect between these peptides and bovine lactoferrin (LF) against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis was also studied. Finally, the most active combinations were assayed against the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella choleraesuis. Results showed a synergistic effect when LFcin-B was combined with bovine LF against E. coli. In the same way, the combination of LFcin-B with bovine LF was synergistic against Staph. epidermidis. Bovine LF and nisin increased their antimicrobial activity when they were assayed together with bovine αs2-casein f(183-207). It is important to note the synergistic effect among LFcin-B and bovine LF, because both compounds might be simultaneously in the suckling gastrointestinal tract and could, therefore, have a protective effect on it. The other synergistic effect high-lighted is that between αs2-casein f(183–207) and nisin against L. monocytogenes because of the ability of L. monocytogenes to develop resistance to nisin.,
3) LFB (FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA-HN2) is a 15-residue linear antimicrobial peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin, which has antimicrobial activity similar to that of the intact 25-residue disulfide-cyclized peptide. Previous alanine-scan studies, in which all of the residues in LFB were individually replaced with Ala, showed that the 2 tryptophan (Trp) residues of LFB were crucial to its antimicrobial activity. When either Trp6 or Trp8 was replaced with Ala (LFBA6 and LFBA8, respectively), these 2 peptides were almost devoid of antimicrobial activity. We determined the structures of LFB, LFBA6, and LFBA8 bound to membrane-mimetic SDS micelles using NMR spectroscopy, and studied their interactions with different phospholipid-model membranes. The membrane interactions of LFB exhibited little correlation with its antimicrobial activity, suggesting that the mechanism of action of LFB involves intracellular targets. However, the much higher antimicrobial activity of LFB compared with LFBA6 and LFBA8 might result, in part, from the formation of energetically favorable cation-pi interactions observed only in LFB. Information about the importance of Arg and Trp cation-pi interactions will provide insight for the future design of potent antimicrobial peptidomimetics.,
4) A physiologically diverse range of Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 μg/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony‐forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.,
5) Lactoferricin B (LF‐B) is a peptide derived from acid‐pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin, which has antimicrobial properties. In order to assess the antimicrobial spectrum of LF‐B and its possible in vivo uses, the minimum inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations of pure lactoferricin B were determined for a range of bacterial species and under varying conditions of growth including growth phase and size of the inoculum, pH and ionic strength of the medium. Lactoferricin B was bactericidal against a wide range of bacteria and Candida albicans. Proteus spp., Pseudomonas cepacia and Serratia spp. were resistant. The bactericidal activity of LF‐B was inhibited by increasing ionic strength and bacterial inoculum and at acid pH. The activity of lactoferricin B was completely inhibited by the addition of 5% whole cow's milk and was reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of mucin. These results indicate the potential of LF‐B to reduce the numbers of organisms in a simple medium, but raise doubts about its role in vivo because of its sensitivity to changes in physical variables. It may be that lactoferricin exerts a transient antimicrobial effect at mucosal surfaces.,
6) Bovine milk contains a high concentration of the protein lactoferrin. It is an important antimicrobial biomolecule, which is also present in other bodily fluids like blood and semen. However, not only the intact protein but also its cleavage products have antimicrobial activity. Perhaps, the best-known cleavage product of lactoferrin is the peptide lactoferricin that has significant antimicrobial capacity against a broad range of pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Interestingly, lactoferricin can interact with the sugar polymer polysialic acid, which is also present in milk, blood, and semen. In the present study, we tested if the binding to polysialic acid influences the biological activity of bovine lactoferricin. Remarkably, neither different amounts of polysialic acid nor different chain lengths of this sugar polymer influenced the antimicrobial activity of lactoferricin. The ability of polysialic acid to bind and not inactivate lactoferricin may allow the development of novel endogenous and biodegradable polysialylated surfaces and/or hydrogels, which can be loaded with the antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin for biomedical applications in veterinary and human medicine.,
7) Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, searching for new antimicrobial agents is an urgent need. In this study, in vitro antibacterial and antimicrobial effects of milk-derived antimicrobial agents, lactoferrin-derived peptides, lactoferricin (Lfc) and lactoferrampin (Lfa) (alone or in combination) and their association with natural extracts have been explored. The assessment of antimicrobial activity was based on two measurements: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Fractional Inhibitory Concentration indexes. Lfc alone is more suitable for inhibiting Staphylococcus intermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis, while Lfa against Candida albicans, a synergistic effect of the two peptides against all the three pathogens has been detected. A strong synergy of all the natural extracts with Lfc and Lfa solution against selected microorganisms in vitro was pointed out. Our results suggest that natural-derived compounds, such as milk peptides and vegetal extracts could be promising tools to treat moderate fungal and bacterial infections."

Treatment of Caco-2 cells with the peptide lactoferricin4–14, results in reduction of the growth rate by prolongation of the S phase of the cell cycle. Lactoferricin1–25 is formed in the gut by cleavage from lactoferrin and the bioactive amino acids are found within lactoferricin4–14. Our hypothesis is that the reduction of the rate of S phase progression may result in increased DNA repair. To test this hypothesis, Caco-2 cells were subjected to UV light that caused DNA lesions and then the cells were grown in the absence or presence of 2.0 μM lactoferricin4–14. Evaluation of DNA strand breaks using the comet assay showed that lactoferricin4–14 treatment indeed resulted in a reduction of comets showing damaged DNA. In the search for a mechanism, we have investigated the levels of several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and apoptosis using Western blot. Lactoferricin4–14 treatment resulted in an increased expression of flap endonuclease-1 pointing to increased DNA synthesis activity. Lactoferricin4–14 treatment decreased the expression of the proapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (or Bax), indicating decreased cell death. As we have found previously, lactoferricin4–14 treatment reduced the expression of cyclin E involved in the G1/S transition. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that a lower γ-H2AX expression in lactoferricin4–14-treated cells, pointing to more efficient DNA repair. Thus, altogether our data show that lactoferricin4–14 treatment has beneficial effects.	10.3168/jds.2011-5279	sequence	IDENTITY

Since human milk does not contain any casein-αs2, these findings could explain the different influence of human and bovine milk on the gastrointestinal flora of the suckling.	10.1016/0014-5793(95)00974-e	sequence	IDENTITY

Takahashi, M., S. Moriguchi, H. Suganuma, A. Shiota, F. Tani, H. Usui, K. Kurahashi, R. Sasaki and M. Yoshikawa. Identification of casoxin C, an ileum-contracting peptide derived from bovine κ-casein, as an agonist for C3a receptors. Peptides 18(3) 329-336, 1997.—Casoxin C (Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg) is a bioactive peptide that was isolated from a tryptic digest of bovine κ-casein as an anti-opioid peptide in longitudinal strips of guinea pig ileum. Casoxin C also evokes contraction of the ileal strips, and we found that this process was biphasic with rapid and slow components. The contractile profile was very similar to that of human complement C3a(70-77), which is the COOH-terminal octapeptide of C3a and has, although less potent, qualitatively the same biological activities as C3a. Casoxin C also has homology with C3a(70-77). The rapid contraction was mediated by histamine release and the slow contraction was mediated by a prostaglandin E2-like substance, judging from the effects of various pharmacological inhibitors and antagonists on the ileal contraction. Casoxin C had affinity for C3a receptors (IC50 = 40 μM) in the radioreceptor assay. In addition, casoxin C showed phagocyte-stimulating activities. Casoxin C is therefore the first milk-derived peptide identified, that acts through complement C3a receptors.	10.1016/s0196-9781(97)00044-2	sequence	IDENTITY

YPSYGLN	P02668	YPSYGLN	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	56-62	Opioid						Biologically active peptides in milk proteins	Meisel, H. et al.	Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.	10.1007/BF02019390	sequence	IDENTITY
YPYY	P07498	YPYY	Kappa-casein	Homo sapiens	55-58	ACE-inhibitory		90.9				Antihypertensive effect of bioactive peptides produced by protease-facilitated lactic acid fermentation of milk	Tsai, J-S. et al.	Milk was fermented for up to 5 h at 43 °C with two lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus). A protease, flavourzyme, was added at the beginning of fermentation. The whey fraction was separated from the fermented milk and freeze-dried. During the 5 h of fermentation, the soluble protein content increased from 4.9 to 57.4 mg/g and peptide content increased from 2.1 to 32.8 mg/g, while inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) increased by a decrease of IC50 from 0.708 to 0.266 mg/ml, respectively. The whey was fractionated into four fractions by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 column. The fourth fraction of the whey showed the highest inhibitory efficiency ratio (IER) being 1329%/mg/ml. The amino acid sequence of the inhibitory peptide was Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, of which the IC50 was 90.9 μM. The whey showed mixed-type inhibition kinetics, while Captopril, the positive control showed competitive inhibition on ACE. Their Ki values were 0.188 mg/ml and 0.0067 μg/ml, respectively. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was reduced to 15.9 and 15.6 mm Hg, respectively, in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), after 8 weeks of oral administration of diluted whey (peptide concentration 4.9 mg/ml).	10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.06.039	sequence	IDENTITY
YPYY	P07498	YPYY	Kappa-casein	Homo sapiens	55-58	DPP-IV Inhibitory		194.4				Susceptibility of milk protein-derived peptides to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) hydrolysis	Nongonierma, A. et al.	In silico digestion of milk protein-derived peptides with gastrointestinal enzyme activities was used to predict the release of peptides with a Pro residue at position 2 from the N terminus. These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.097	sequence	IDENTITY
YPYY	P07498	YPYY	Kappa-casein	Homo sapiens	55-58	Opioid	Opioid antagonist					Opioid antagonist peptides derived from kappa-casein	Chiba, H. et al.	Opioid antagonists were sought in the fragments of κ-casein which were obtained by chemical synthesis and enzymic digestion. A synthetic bovine κ-casein peptide (35–41), Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Asn (casoxin A) showed opioid antagonist activity at 200 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. A synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr (casoxin B) which is found in bovine and human κ-casein, also showed opioid antagonist activity at 100 μM. Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine κ-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to κ-casein (25–34). Casoxin C was active at 5 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine κ-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.	10.1017/s0022029900028818	sequence	IDENTITY
