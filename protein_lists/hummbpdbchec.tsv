RYYGY	P02788	RYYGY	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	543-547	Opioid	Opioid antagonist					Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory and antioxidative properties of milk protein-derived dipeptides and hydrolysates	Tani, F. et al.	Peptides with affinity for opioid receptors were found in an artificially methyl-esterified peptic digest of human lactoferrin. Three active peptides were purified by two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their structures were Tyr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Gly-Tyr-OCH3, Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-OCH2, and Lys-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Tyr-OCH3, which respectively correspond to the methyl esters of residues 318-323, 536-540, and 673-679 of human lactoferrin. The IC50 values of these peptides were 15, 10 and 23 microM, respectively, in a radioreceptor assay in the presence of 1 nM [3H]naloxone. In the myenteric plexus preparation of the longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum, the individual peptides had no opioid agonist activities, but they antagonized [Met5]enkephalin and morphiceptin when they were at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-5) M, suggesting that these were the opioid antagonist peptides. These three opioid antagonist peptides were named lactoferroxin A, B and C, after casoxin, the opioid antagonist peptide derived from bovine kappa-casein. Concerning the antagonist activities of lactoferroxins for opioid receptor sub-types, lactoferroxin A showed preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C had somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors. A study of the structure-activity relationship of the three lactoferroxins and their synthetic analogues showed that these opioid antagonist peptides derived from food protein could be expressed by the general formula XA-Tyr-XB-Tyr-OCH3. An amino acid in position XA may affect the specificity of the antagonist peptide for opioid receptor sub-types.	10.1080/00021369.1990.10870214	sequence	IDENTITY

YLGSGY	P02788	YLGSGY	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	338-343	Opioid	Opioid antagonist					Opioid antagonist peptides derived from kappa-casein	Chiba, H. et al.	Opioid antagonists were sought in the fragments of Îº-casein which were obtained by chemical synthesis and enzymic digestion. A synthetic bovine Îº-casein peptide (35â41), Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Asn (casoxin A) showed opioid antagonist activity at 200 Î¼M in the guinea pig ileum assay. A synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr (casoxin B) which is found in bovine and human Îº-casein, also showed opioid antagonist activity at 100 Î¼M. Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine Îº-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to Îº-casein (25â34). Casoxin C was active at 5 Î¼M in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine Îº-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.	10.1017/s0022029900028818	sequence	IDENTITY

FFSASCVPGADKGQFPNLCRLCAGTGENKCA	P02788	FFSASCVPGADKGQFPNLCRLCAGTGENKCA	Lactotransferrin	Homo sapiens	171-201	Antimicrobial				Antibacterial, Antifungal		Different anti-Candida activities of two human lactoferrin-derived peptides, Lfpep and kaliocin-1	Viejo-Diaz, M. et al.	The synthetic peptides Lfpep and kaliocin-1 include the sequences from positions 18 to 40 and 153 to 183 of human lactoferrin, respectively. Lfpep is a cationic peptide with bactericidal and giardicidal effects, whereas kaliocin-1 is a novel bactericidal peptide that corresponds to a highly homologous sequence present in the transferrin family of proteins. Both peptides presented fungicidal activity against Candida spp., including fluconazole- and amphotericin B-resistant clinical isolates. Lfpep exhibited higher antifungal activity (8- to 30-fold) and salt resistance than kaliocin-1. The killing activity of Lfpep was mediated by its permeabilizing activity on Candida albicans cells, whereas kaliocin-1 was unable to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, as indicated by its inability to allow permeation of propidium iodide and the small amount of K+ released. The amino acid sequence of kaliocin-1 includes the âmultidimensional antimicrobial signatureâ conserved in disulfide-containing antimicrobial peptides and a striking similarity to brevinin-1Sa, an antimicrobial peptide from frog skin secretions, exhibiting a âRana boxâ-like sequence. These features may be of interest in the design of new antifungals.	10.1128/AAC.49.7.2583-2588.2005	sequence	IDENTITY
